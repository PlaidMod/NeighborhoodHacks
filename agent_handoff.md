# Agent handoff log

A shared log of changes made in this repo, so the next teammate or agent can catch up without reading every diff. Entries follow `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: record the teammate, never the agent or model.

## Rules for agents

1. **At the start of a session,** read the newest 3–5 entries below, plus any entry that touches the files you're about to change.
2. **After you add, edit or delete anything in the repo,** add one entry before you finish the task or commit. One entry per task, not per file.
3. **Put new entries at the top,** directly under "Entries." Never edit or delete someone else's entry. If an older entry is now wrong, say so in your new entry.
4. **Keep it short.** Aim for under 15 lines, and write for a teammate who hasn't seen the code.
5. **Flag shared-contract changes** in the "Contract changes" line. Other parts are built against these, so a silent change breaks them:
   - DB schema (Technical_Implementation_Plan.md §16)
   - `Meeting` and `Item` types (§6)
   - `bodies_token` format (§3)
   - the `classify()` signature (§8)
   - types in `lib/prototype/types.ts` (the `/app` screens' data shapes; moved from `web/src/lib/data/types.ts`)
6. **On a merge conflict in this file,** keep both entries, newest first.

### 2026-10-23: The week in short moves onto the dashboard as a few sentences
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - The dashboard home now opens with "This week, in short" under the greeting, in place of the status line and the link to `/app/tldr`. It's a short paragraph, not a list: "Just decided:" and "Coming up:" followed by up to three headlines in all (at most two decisions), each upcoming one with its day, then when sign-up to speak closes for the soonest one shown. Each headline opens its story sheet, which links to the official source.
  - It uses the items' own headlines and writes no new text. Template "Outcome not posted yet" headlines are skipped. The AI label shows when any headline was written with AI. With nothing to show it says "Nothing new from your local governments this week."
  - `/app/tldr` now forwards to `/app`, and "Week in short" left the sidebar. The page-only helpers (`tldrLine`, `readMinutes`, `tldrFootnote`) and their `AppTldr` messages are gone.
  - Deploy: Vercel blocked the automatic and CLI deploys of Marie Gary Blueberry's commits through 4fcf955 (private repo; a CLI deploy that carries the teammate's commit is blocked too). PlaidMod deployed 4fcf955 with `vercel deploy --prod` from a `git archive` copy. CLAUDE.md now says so.
  - Restored my "Accessibility fixes" entry below, which a merge had shortened to one line.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/tldr/page.tsx` (redirect), `lib/prototype/tldr.ts` (`tldrPick`, `asSentence`), `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `messages/*.json`, `tests/prototype/{home,tldr,tldrRedirect}.test.ts` (`tldrPage.test.ts` removed), `DESIGN.md` §8, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** The new tests failed first, then passed. `npm test` (875 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck and build pass; lint fails only on `app-tour.tsx:44` (above). In a local production build with real data for 901 Bagby St 77002, English at 1280px and Spanish at 390px: three AI headlines (two decided, one coming up) flow as one paragraph with the AI label; Enter on a headline opens its story sheet; `/app/tldr` lands on `/app`; no sideways scroll. The first real-data check showed template headlines ("Vote Oct. 27: ORDINANCE…"), so AI headlines now come first.
- **Open issues / next:** On the live landing page after 4fcf955 (measured in the browser): the transparent footer's About, Privacy and Terms links are about 1.1:1 against the grass at 1280px, well under 4.5:1; at 390px the "Your neighborhood, decoded" eyebrow sits under the header, and the last stack card's text ("And ones you've never heard of") is cut off. The landing photo is a 2.5 MB PNG, and `courthouse-hero.png`, `courthouse-hero-v2.png` and `calm-sea-hero.jpg` are unused. `npm run lint` fails on `components/prototype/app-tour.tsx:44` (setState in an effect). The dashboard home's other text is still English only.

### 2026-10-23: Give countdown units more breathing room
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main

### 2026-10-23: Remove landing footer background band
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the hero's cream fade overlay that created a distinct horizontal grass bar and made the landing footer transparent so the courthouse background continues behind it. Reduced the cream wash over the hero to make the image more visible.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; visual browser check not run.

- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience

- **What changed:** Limited the weekly brief's lead grid to four cards and clamped their headlines to two lines. Kept the existing onboarding, then added an English/Spanish spotlight tour through Home, Weekly brief, Timeline, and Speak up, with bottom progress tabs, Skip, and a final Done action.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/brief/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/speak/speak.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/start/onboarding.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-tour.tsx`, `messages/*.json`, `agent_handoff.md`

- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed. Browser visual check not run.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Fade the grass band into the landing footer
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Restored the footer's left/right layout with vertical alignment, and added a fade from the background image into the footer cream to soften the visible grass band at the bottom of the hero.
- **Files:** `components/shell/SiteFooter.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed.

### 2026-10-23: Smooth the courthouse lawn and footer edge
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Replaced the landing background with a version whose left lawn transition is less stripe-like, and removed the footer's top border that emphasized the image boundary.
- **Files:** `public/photos/courthouse-hero-v4.png`, `app/globals.css`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed. Browser visual check not run.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Accessibility fixes from a web interface guidelines review
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Fixed the top findings from a review of `/app/tldr`, the dashboard home and the app shell:
  - On `/app/tldr`, the Spanish sign-up chip ran 54px past its card at 320px and made the page scroll sideways. It now wraps.
  - Two text pairs were below 4.5:1. "Your next step" on red measured 4.31:1 and is now 5.85:1. The sidebar's "Menu" and "General" labels measured 3.14:1 and are now 6.05:1; the `/70` fading is gone.
  - The two sidebar `<nav>`s are now named "Menu" and "General".
  - The Timeline link's urgent badge now reads as "2 urgent" to screen readers (new `AppShell.nav.urgentCount`).
  - The home status line says "1 thing", not "1 things".
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/tldr/page.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json`, `tests/prototype/tldrPage.test.ts`, `tests/platform/appShellText.test.ts`, `tests/prototype/home.test.ts` (new)
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** The 6 new tests failed first, then passed. `npm test` (880 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build pass. In a local production build: no sideways scroll at 320px in Spanish, contrast measured from the rendered colors, and the accessibility tree shows "Timeline 2 urgent" and both nav names.
- **Open issues / next:** Still open from the review:
  - The dashboard home's text is English only (about 30 strings), and its election date "Tuesday, Nov 3" is typed by hand.
  - Search renders every update with no cap (a downtown address can have about 760 items).
  - The countdown reads letter by letter to screen readers.
  - Headline buttons on `/app/tldr` could use `aria-haspopup="dialog"`, and its "Official source" links are small tap targets.
  - Adding `aria-keyshortcuts` to the search button would announce Ctrl K.

### 2026-10-23: Use the full ShowUp HTX name in the landing copy
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Updated the landing page description in English and Spanish to use the full product name, ShowUp HTX.

### 2026-10-23: Remove the foreground stripe and use the cream footer color
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience

- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience

### 2026-10-23: Align the landing stack's right edges
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Matched each card's width reduction to its rightward offset so all right edges line up and the left edges form an even staircase. Kept the final card slightly shorter and its label smaller.

- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed. Browser visual check not run.

### 2026-10-23: Set the landing stack's staircase alignment
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Made each card narrow faster than it shifts right, so the staircase steps inward on both its left and right edges instead of keeping a shared right edge.
- **Files:** `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed. Browser visual check not run.

### 2026-10-23: Set steady descending stack dimensions
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience

### 2026-10-23: Remove the oversized landing preview frame

- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the feature cards beneath the hero and rebuilt the top section around the headline, address action, prominent Google sign-up, and a glass government preview. Made the generated cream-toned sea backdrop more visible, extended it behind a translucent header, and removed the extra copy under the buttons. Preserved the latest account-deletion confirmation on the home page after pulling.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, `components/shell/SiteHeader.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `public/photos/calm-sea-hero.jpg`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed after the pull and visual adjustments. Tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: "Week in short", the weekly brief in one minute (`/app/tldr`)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** New page `/app/tldr` for readers short on time. It shows one sentence of counts, up to 5 coming-up items and up to 3 decisions, each as a headline plus one line on what it means, with sign-up and vote chips and an "Official source" link. It also has a "Your next step" card for the soonest sign-up deadline and a link to the full brief. It uses the same data and order as `/app/brief` (`buildWeekly` with real data, the demo ranking otherwise). It writes no new text and makes no AI calls, and it ends with the AI label when any summary shown was written with AI. It's on the sidebar ("Week in short") and linked under the dashboard greeting; per DESIGN.md §8 that's a link, not another panel. The line under each headline (`tldrLine`) is the reader's own role line, then the story summary, then the general note. Real stories' general note is the renter line ("Renters can weigh in too…"), which said nothing about the item, so the summary comes before it.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/tldr/page.tsx`, `lib/prototype/tldr.ts` (new), `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx` (nav), `app/(prototype)/app/page.tsx` (link), `messages/*.json` (`AppTldr`, `AppShell.nav.tldr`), `tests/prototype/tldr.test.ts`, `tests/prototype/tldrPage.test.ts`, `DESIGN.md` §8, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes:** None. `/app/brief` keeps its own picking code. It could switch to `buildTldr()` later, but I left it alone because it's being changed today.
- **Checked:** The new tests failed first, then passed. `npm test` (870 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build pass. In a local production build with demo data: English at 1280px and Spanish at 390px with no sideways scroll; the home link opens the page and a headline opens its story, with no console errors. Live after the first push, with real data for 901 Bagby St 77002: 23 coming up, 21 open for comment, 7 decided; the next-step card, source links and AI label show, with no console errors or sideways scroll. That check found the renter-line problem above.
- **Open issues / next:** The dashboard home's own text is still English only. Demo items are English in Spanish too, as before.

### 2026-10-23: Screen readers read the news panel's Spanish note in Spanish
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (fix in P3's news coverage panel)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** On Spanish pages, the "What news coverage says" panel is English by design (perspectives spec N13) and is marked `lang="en"`. Its Spanish note, "Esta sección solo está disponible en inglés.", sat inside that marking, so screen readers read it with an English voice. The note now carries `lang="es"`. The panel's other text stays English, as the spec says (that includes `Coverage.sourcesOnly`, which only looks untranslated in `es.json`).
- **Files:** `components/weekly/Coverage.tsx`, `tests/perspectives/coverageLang.test.ts` (new)
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** The new test renders the open panel in English and Spanish. It failed before the fix, passes with it, and fails again with the fix stashed. `npm test` (853 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build pass. Not checked in a browser or with a screen reader.

### 2026-10-23: Alerts checkboxes aligned; merge note on the sidebar toggle
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Checkboxes:** in both alerts sign-up forms (`PushSignup`, `AlertSignup`), the "I'm under 18" checkbox sat in a padded `bg-surface` panel. That panel is invisible on the white UI, so the box looked indented; the padding is removed so every checkbox lines up.
  - **Merge:** while merging origin/main, I kept the teammate's translated toggle labels and the visible "Sidebar" word (now `AppShell.toggle.label`). I changed `toggle.show` and `toggle.hide` to "Show sidebar" and "Hide sidebar" (Spanish: "Mostrar/Ocultar el menú lateral"), so the accessible name contains the visible word.
- **Files:** `components/alerts/{PushSignup,AlertSignup}.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `messages/*.json`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** See the merge commit: `npm test`, lint and typecheck were run after the merge.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: AI summaries on click, a shorter calendar day list, an iPhone lock-screen preview
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (reuses P4's coach)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:**
  - **AI summary:** opening an item that has no written story now shows an "AI summary" block in the story sheet, using P4's `/api/coach` explain mode (the same as Speak up's "Explain this item"). It shows a plain summary plus who it affects, a "Summarizing with AI" state with bouncing dots while it loads, and the AI label.
    - Answers are cached in sessionStorage per item and language, so reopening costs nothing.
    - If the coach can't explain an item (for example, a decided one), the block hides.
    - The "Why it matters: The agenda item is linked below." placeholder is gone: `why` is empty without a story, and the brief's "For you" line hides too.
  - **Calendar day panel:** deadlines at the same time collapse into one line ("Sign-up closes 8:00 AM · for 18 items"). The panel shows at most 5 items, then "See all N on the timeline".
  - **Alerts preview:** the chat-bubble mockup is now an iPhone lock screen (Dynamic Island, clock, frosted notification banners, flashlight and camera). Its text comes from `lib/push/message.ts` (`itemNotice`, `reminderNotice`), the same code that sends notifications.
  - **Grammar:** "1 minutes per speaker" is now an ICU plural (`AppStory.signupCloses`).
- **Files:** `components/prototype/story-sheet.tsx`, `lib/prototype/live.ts`, `app/(prototype)/app/brief/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/alerts/alerts.tsx`, `messages/*.json`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser on real data: a real AI summary loaded for a Commissioners Court item (the loading state was checked with a 3-second delay), the day panel is collapsed, and the lock screen renders. No console errors.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **AI summaries and the coach's limit:** each summary uses one coach call. Without `COACH_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER`, all visitors share 20 calls an hour, so set it on Vercel (`x-real-ip`) if it isn't set yet.

### 2026-10-23: Weekly brief: real calendar, compact deadlines, no empty column
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** Below the bento on `/app/brief`, the two-column layout (decided stories plus a side rail) left half the page empty when nothing was decided. Everything now stacks full width:
  - **Deadlines this week:** compact cards with a date block, "Sign-up to speak closes · time", the item's two-line headline (not `buildWeekly`'s long label) and the body.
  - **On the calendar:** a real two-week grid (Sunday to Saturday, Central time) with today marked. Each day shows up to two items (time and title, red edge for urgent) plus "+N more", which links to the timeline. Phones get a day-by-day list instead.
  - **Also decided:** shown only when there's something.
  - **One thing you can do:** a full-width banner. It also fixes "Speak for 1 minutes" (ICU plural).
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/brief/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`AppBrief.signupCloses`, `deadline`, `more`, `speakFor`)
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass. In the browser on real data at 1536px and 390px, there's no horizontal scroll and no console errors.
- **Follow-up (same day):** the deadlines section is folded into the calendar, and cells carry less text.
  - **Each cell:** the day number, a red "Sign-up 8:00 AM" tag on deadline days, and one line per meeting (body logo, short name, item count). No item titles.
  - **Day panel:** clicking a day lists its deadlines and items underneath, one line each, with "See all N on the timeline". The next busy day is selected by default.
  - **Phones:** a scrollable row of days with dots, plus the same day panel.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Shorter titles, a clearer Speak up, no falling books
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (touches P4's Speak up; P4, please review)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:**
  - **No repeated title:** items without a story showed the shortened official title as the headline, then the full title again as the summary. Now `summary` is empty for those, and a new `Update.officialTitle` holds the full wording. The story sheet and Speak up's Understand step show it under a collapsed "Official agenda text".
  - **Shorter headlines:** `agendaHeadline` now caps at 90 characters and drops a dangling "of", "&" or "to the" before the "…".
  - **Speak up (P4's screen):**
    - The subtitle now says what the page is for: "Tell your local government what you think before it votes".
    - A "What this is for" note explains public comment: speaking at the meeting or sending a written comment.
    - Fixed the agenda list: `line-clamp-2 block` let the `block` class cancel the clamp, so titles ran five or six lines.
  - **Timeline:** the heading is left-aligned again, and the falling books are removed (`falling-books.tsx` deleted, along with the shell's `isolate`).
- **Files:** `lib/prototype/{live,types}.ts`, `lib/weekly/agendaTitle.ts`, `tests/weekly/agendaTitle.test.ts`, `components/prototype/{story-sheet,app-shell}.tsx`, `components/speak/understand.tsx` (P4's), `app/(prototype)/app/speak/speak.tsx` (P4's), `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`speak.subtitle`, `speak.whatTitle`, `speak.whatBody`, `speak.officialText`, `AppStory.officialText`)
- **Contract changes:** `Update` gains `officialTitle`, and `summary` is empty for items with no story.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (824), lint and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser on real data, the Speak up list titles stop at two lines, the subtitle and note show, the timeline heading is left-aligned, and no books render. No console errors.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Falling-books background, centered heading, labeled sidebar toggle
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** on `/app/timeline`:
  - **Falling books:** faint gray books tumble down the background as you scroll (`components/prototype/falling-books.tsx`, Motion `useScroll`, tablet and up). They're scroll-linked and reversible, still with reduced motion, and never take clicks. The shell's wrapper is now `isolate`, so the books sit above the gray page but below the sidebar, top bar and cards.
  - **Heading:** "Timeline" is centered over the timeline column.
  - **Sidebar on each visit:** every visit to the timeline starts with the sidebar hidden. Before, reopening it there kept it open on the next visit.
  - **Toggle label:** the toggle now reads "› Sidebar", and its accessible name is "Show sidebar" or "Hide sidebar".
- **Files:** `components/prototype/falling-books.tsx` (new), `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - Lint, typecheck and tests pass.
  - In the browser, the books move with scroll, the heading is centered, and after opening the sidebar, going to the brief and coming back, the sidebar is hidden again. No console errors.
- **Follow-up:**
  - The books now fall only through the timeline column. The layer tracks the column with a ResizeObserver and fades out near the top, so none sit under the top bar.
  - Six books instead of nine.
  - The first two tiles' photos load eagerly.
- **Note:** the dev overlay's "1 Issue" is React's dev-only "Failed to execute 'measure' on 'Performance' … negative time stamp" bug, not app code. The remaining LCP warning is a false positive, because many tiles share `cityhall.jpg` and Next matches images by file name.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Less on the timeline; the left column folds away when the sidebar opens
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The teammate found `/app/timeline` crowded.
  - **Sidebar open:** opening the sidebar (the › button) now folds away the left column (the big count, the memo and the topics). The column's grid track animates to zero, so the timeline slides left; closing the sidebar brings it back. The shell shares its open state through `useNavOpen()` (`components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`).
  - **Removed:** the "Everything / For you / Coming up / Decided" tabs; the generic tags on photo tiles (only "Urgent" remains); and "Read the weekly brief" in quick actions (the sidebar already links to it).
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Lint and tests pass. In the browser at 1100, 1280, 1440 and 1920px, with the sidebar open and closed, the left column hides and returns, there's no horizontal scroll and there are no console errors.
- **Follow-up (same day):** with the sidebar hidden, the three columns were still crowded.
  - Gutters are now 64px, the side columns are narrower (left 240px, right 272px), and the center tiles are 86% wide.
  - Everything is scaled down: the count (4.5–5.5rem), memo, chips, title, tile headlines (clamped to 3 lines), photos (150–170px tall), countdown and quick actions.
- **Open issues / next:** The `AppTimeline.tabs.*` and `qBrief` message keys are unused now.
### 2026-10-23: Search in /app no longer crashes the page; landing page leftovers fixed
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Search crash (live bug):** opening search in `/app` (the search box or Ctrl/⌘K) replaced the whole page with "This page couldn't load". The app's shadcn `CommandDialog` doesn't wrap its children in cmdk's `<Command>` root, and the search panel put `CommandInput` and `CommandList` straight inside it, so cmdk found no store ("reading 'subscribe'"). The search panel now wraps them in `<Command>`, with a translated dialog title and description. This has likely been broken since the screens moved to the root app (Oct 20).
  - **Landing page leftovers** from the UI polish entry below:
    - The two hero buttons are now the same size (56px, 16px text).
    - `/address` uses `bg-muted` instead of the hex `#f4f6f9`.
    - Icons beside semibold text on `/`, `/address` and the address form render a 2px stroke. Lucide's `absoluteStrokeWidth` needs the `size` prop; a CSS size class alone leaves it at 2 units.
  - **Correction to my guideline review below:** the search list's dates were never English-only. `relDay()` already reads `<html lang>` and formats in Central time; in Spanish they read "1 nov", "Jueves", "Hace 4 días".
- **Files:** `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/address/page.tsx`, `components/home/AddressForm.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`AppShell.search.description`), `tests/platform/appShellText.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None. Any other `CommandDialog` must also wrap its contents in `<Command>`.
- **Checked:**
  - Live before the fix: clicking Search on `/app` showed "This page couldn't load" with the same error.
  - The new test failed first, passes with the fix, and fails again with the fix stashed. `npm test` (850 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - Local Chromium, English and Spanish: search opens from the button and from Ctrl K, filters as you type, shows translated headings and dates, with no page errors. Hero buttons are both 56px at 1280px and 390px. Icon strokes are 3 at 16px and 2.4 at 20px (2px rendered).
- **Open issues / next:** The app's colors in `app/manifest.ts` are still the old cream and brick. Lucide icons elsewhere in the app still use the default stroke.

### 2026-10-23: "Delete my account", the app shell in Spanish, and a skip link in /app
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Delete my account:** signed-in readers get "Delete my account" in the account menu. It opens `/account/delete`, which explains what's deleted and asks to confirm.
    - The button posts to `/auth/delete` through `DeleteAccountForm`, which clears the saved address first.
    - The route refuses posts from other sites (Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site checks), guests and team admin accounts (the team removes those by hand).
    - It deletes the Supabase user, whose `account_profiles` row goes with it (on delete cascade). Then it signs out, clears the government and role cookies, and lands on `/?deleted=1`, which shows "Your account is deleted".
    - The privacy page (en/es) now points to the button instead of "ask us on our project page".
    - The menu's sign-out also shows for a signed-in reader before their first lookup.
  - **App shell in Spanish:** the sidebar, sample-data banners, search, account menu and role names now come from the new `AppShell` messages in English and Spanish. Spanish matches existing wording ("Hazte escuchar", "Datos de muestra", "Cerrar sesión").
  - **Motion and guideline pass:**
    - The "signed in" and "account deleted" confirmations on the home page rise in once (`.status-in`: 250ms with the new `--ease-out-strong`; a 200ms fade under reduced motion).
    - `/app` gets the same "Skip to content" link as the public pages.
    - Page headings use balanced wrapping, and the avatar has explicit width and height.
  - **Three small guideline fixes:**
    - The search hint shows ⌘K on Apple devices and Ctrl K elsewhere (`lib/prototype/shortcut.ts`), after hydration.
    - The delete button shows "Deleting your account…" with a spinner once pressed, and ignores a second press.
    - The address placeholder shows an example: "e.g. 901 Bagby St, Houston, TX 77002…".
- **Files:** `app/auth/delete/route.ts`, `app/(public)/account/delete/page.tsx`, `lib/accountDeletion.ts` (new); `components/prototype/{app-shell,sign-out-form}.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json`, `docs/testing-checklist.md`, `app/globals.css`, `app/(public)/address/page.tsx`; tests `accountDeletion`, `appShellText` (new), `signOut`, `messages`
- **Contract changes:** None to the schema. Privacy (§19): readers can now delete their own account. Tech plan §16 and §19 still don't mention `account_profiles` or deletion; not edited, since no teammate asked for a plan change. Every form posting to `/auth/delete` must use `DeleteAccountForm` (a test checks).
- **Checked:**
  - Tests: the new tests failed first, then passed; `npm test` (844 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck and lint pass.
  - Refusals (local): a post with no Origin, or from another site, goes to `?error=cross_site`; a signed-out post goes to `/signin`.
  - End to end with a throwaway `@example.com` user with a saved profile, in local Chromium: menu, confirm page, deletion, then the home page message, an empty profile and no cookies. In Supabase, the user and its row were gone, with no leftover test users or orphaned rows.
  - Spanish shell in Chromium: no English left in the shell, and no sideways scroll at 390px.
  - Also in Chromium: the confirmation uses `status-rise` normally and `status-fade` under reduced motion. The first Tab in `/app` shows the skip link, and the next Tab after it lands inside the main content. With a second throwaway user: one press sends one request; the button reads "Deleting your account…" with a spinner, and a second press is blocked. The flow still ends deleted. The search hint reads Ctrl K on Windows. No leftover test users or orphaned rows.
- **Open issues / next:** Dates in the search list (`relDay`) and the dashboards' own text are still English (UI owner). Push subscriptions aren't tied to accounts, so deleting an account leaves browser alerts on; turn them off on the Alerts page.

### 2026-10-23: UI polish pass: focus rings, hover tints and shadows work again under the glass style
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Marie Gary Blueberry's glass style (below) sat outside every CSS layer, so it beat Tailwind's utilities. The address box and buttons lost their focus rings, white buttons lost their hover tint (the Google button), and cards lost their own shadows (the sign-in card). The edge, depth and blur now live in `@layer components`, and the see-through fill in `@layer utilities`. The glass look stays, and an element's own utilities win. The glass edge is now a shadow ring over a transparent border, so forced-colors mode still draws it.
  - The landing page's feature labels showed raw keys (`Home.feature1Label`); it now uses the existing `featureOneLabel` keys.
  - The header's new "Find my governments" button made every public page scroll sideways at 390px. It now shows from 640px up; the page itself offers the action on phones.
  - `/address` showed the privacy sentence twice; the address form already shows it.
  - Polish: menus, the search list and address suggestions no longer scroll the page behind them. The switch names its transition properties. The results cards' hover zoom animates instead of jumping. The Google avatar gets a faint outline.
- **Files:** `app/globals.css`, `app/(public)/{page,address/page,results/page}.tsx`, `components/shell/SiteHeader.tsx`, `components/home/AddressForm.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `components/ui/{dropdown-menu,command,switch}.tsx`, `tests/platform/cssLayers.test.ts` (new)
- **Contract changes:** None. New rule: don't set box-shadow, border, outline or background in CSS outside a layer; `cssLayers.test.ts` fails if you do.
- **Checked:**
  - Tests and build: the new test failed first, then passed; `npm test` (832 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - Local Chromium: focus rings on the address box and the primary and Google buttons; the Google hover tint; the sign-in card shadow; glass fill and blur on cards.
  - No sideways scroll at 390, 640 and 1280px on `/`, `/address`, `/about` and `/privacy` in English, or at 390px in Spanish (`/signin` included).
- **Open issues / next (left for the landing page's owner):** The hero's two buttons are different sizes (main action 56px, Google 64px), so the secondary outweighs the main one. `/address` uses a hex background (`bg-[#f4f6f9]`), but the rules say tokens only. Lucide icons keep their default stroke beside semibold text.

### 2026-10-23: Apply a shared glass surface style
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · app-wide visual system
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added a soft tinted canvas and translucent, blurred treatment to white and surface panels across public and app routes. Added a restrained highlight and depth to denim, ink and brick surfaces while preserving their palette colors and text contrast intent.
- **Files:** `app/globals.css`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check`; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: Refresh the landing page and smooth route changes
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reworked the landing page around a centered hero, large actions and a rounded product preview built from ShowUp's real government stack and existing copy. Added a localized address CTA to the header and a short fade for route changes, disabled for reduced-motion preferences.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/template.tsx`, `app/globals.css`, `components/shell/SiteHeader.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed. `npm run build` could not fetch Geist from Google Fonts due unavailable network access; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session; validate the new landing page and route fade when browser access is available.

### 2026-10-23: Enlarge sign-in and align the stack label
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public landing page
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Enlarged the Google sign-in action with a wider desktop target and full-width mobile button. Reset the final government-stack label to full width, aligning it with the first card and the stack's shared right edge; this supersedes the prior desktop inset adjustment.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `git diff --check`, and local homepage request (200); tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: Align the final government-stack label
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · home page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Matched the “ones you’ve never heard of” label’s desktop inset to the last government card so the stack continues its stagger consistently. Mobile remains flush with the stack edge.
- **Files:** `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: Anchor and compact the public footer
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public site layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Made the public shell fill at least the viewport height so the footer sits at the bottom instead of leaving unused space beneath it. Tightened the footer's vertical padding and internal gaps. The planning stress test was skipped for this fix at the teammate's request.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/layout.tsx`, `components/shell/SiteFooter.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `git diff --check`, and local homepage request (200); tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: Split the landing page from address lookup
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public experience
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Made `/` a full ShowUp landing page with a product hero, clear address lookup and Google sign-in actions, and three feature summaries. Added `/address` for address entry and moved the app's change-address links there.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/address/page.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit`, `git diff --check`, and local requests to `/` and `/address` (both 200); tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check unavailable in this session.

### 2026-10-23: Make Google sign-in prominent on the landing page
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public landing page
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Replaced the small inline Google sign-in link with a larger outlined button and Google icon. The button goes directly to the Google sign-in route and fills the available width on mobile.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Enlarge Weekly section headers
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Increased the Weekly section-rule heading from 12px to 16px, scaling to 18px on desktop, and eased letter spacing so the label is easier to read.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/weekly/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Align Weekly story cards within each row
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Weekly cards now stretch to the same height as their row, with action buttons and sign-up deadlines aligned along the bottom. This removes the uneven card edges and staggered action spacing.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/weekly/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Show two more stories in the Weekly tile grid
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Expanded the Weekly tile set from five to seven using two more palette styles. The grid now fills its second desktop row with the next two available upcoming stories.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/weekly/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Signing out clears the saved address; Google sign-in is on
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Marie Gary Blueberry's change below ("Remember addresses in this browser only") keeps the street address in `showup.profile.v1`. But "Sign out and forget this browser" left the address there, so the next person on a shared computer saw it. Every sign-out button now uses `SignOutForm`, which clears the profile before posting to `/auth/signout`. The menu also shows the button whenever an address is saved.
  - The sample-data banner told every new visitor "Your address is saved in this browser", because the sample profile (Maya) has an address. It now checks `hasSavedAddress()`.
  - The privacy page (en/es) says signing out removes the saved address. Docs updated at the owner's request: tech plan §3 and §19, DESIGN.md, CLAUDE.md, the testing checklist and readiness.
- **Files:** `components/prototype/sign-out-form.tsx` (new), `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `lib/prototype/profile-storage.ts`, `messages/*.json`, `tests/platform/signOut.test.ts` (new), `tests/platform/messages.test.ts`, the docs above
- **Contract changes:** Privacy (§3, §19): signing out now clears the browser's saved address. New sign-out buttons must use `SignOutForm`; a test fails on any page or component that posts to `/auth/signout` directly.
- **Checked:**
  - Tests and build: the new tests failed first, then passed; `npm test` (830 Vitest + 72 P4), typecheck, lint and build all pass.
  - Local Chromium: banner text for a new visitor and for a saved address; sign-out by mouse and by keyboard lands on `/` with the profile gone.
  - Google sign-in: PlaidMod turned it on (Google Cloud client; Supabase provider; Site URL `https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app`; redirect URLs for `/auth/callback` on the live site and localhost:3000). The live button reaches Google's login screen with Supabase's callback, and a bad code returns to `/signin?error=failed`. A live sign-in created one Google user. Its `account_profiles` row is written after the first signed-in lookup, as designed.
- **Open issues / next:** The app shell's banner and menu text are still English only. Account deletion is still by request. This push also deploys 7c1fd1e, which Vercel had blocked as a teammate commit.

### 2026-10-23: Fill the public weekly story cards with story summaries
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The previous tile adjustment affected the prototype brief, while the reported screen is the public Weekly page. Public cards now show each available story dek, place the action beneath the text, and use content-sized rows without the extra tall spans.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/weekly/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Repair Harris County meeting information link
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · government details
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Replaced the retired Commissioners Court URL with Harris County's current agenda portal and added a detail-page fallback so existing database rows with the old URL work immediately. The catalog's source now points to the county's current Office of County Administration meeting-information page.
- **Files:** `data/bodies.yaml`, `components/flow/BodyDetailClient.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Official Harris County agenda and meeting-information pages verified; `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- **Open issues / next:** The existing database catalog row can be refreshed with `npm run seed:bodies -- --apply`; the page fallback covers it in the meantime.

### 2026-10-23: Improve government card hover and return navigation
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public lookup and government details
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Government result cards now use a straight right arrow and only highlight and slightly enlarge on hover. The government detail link now returns to Your governments and carries the result token, so the lookup page is reachable without re-entering the address.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `components/flow/BodyDetailClient.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Remember addresses in this browser only
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P5 privacy and address lookup
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The public lookup now saves the normalized address in the existing `showup.profile.v1` local profile and prefills it on return. Address data remains out of server storage, cookies, links, logs, and account sync; English/Spanish privacy copy and the plan/checklist now reflect browser-only retention. The app keeps sample data clearly labeled until a looked-up government list is available.
- **Files:** `lib/prototype/profile-storage.ts`, `lib/prototype/profile.tsx`, `components/home/AddressForm.tsx`, `components/prototype/address-form.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `components/flow/LookupProvider.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `docs/testing-checklist.md`, `docs/readiness.md`, `docs/project-pace.md`, `tests/platform/messages.test.ts`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** User address retention is now browser-local only; no server or account persistence.
- **Checked:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `git diff --check` passed; tests not run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Keep Speak up navigation visible while scrolling
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P4 Speak up
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The back/continue controls now stick to the bottom of the viewport while moving through the long Speak up steps, so the next action stays visible. Removed the panel overflow that would prevent sticky positioning.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/speak/speak.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Use the full article content width
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the remaining max-width limits from article detail content so the headline, story text, meeting details, action panel, source, and coverage fill the available page width.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/items/[id]/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Widen the public article details page
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the 3xl cap around article details, widened the headline, meeting metadata, and supporting sections, and kept story paragraphs at a narrower reading width.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/items/[id]/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Fill out and shorten weekly story tiles
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · prototype weekly brief
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the two story tiles' two-row spans to reduce unused height, gave desktop tiles a compact minimum row size, and added the story summary beneath each headline.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/brief/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Tighten spacing at the bottom of public pages
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · public site layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reduced bottom padding across public pages and tightened the shared footer gap. Kept each page's top spacing unchanged; shortened the weekly page's closing gap as well.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/*/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `components/shell/SiteFooter.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Add back and home actions to article navigation
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added a left-arrow link back to this week's stories and an explicit Home button in the news top navigation. Removed the less-visible text back link from article pages and localized Home in English and Spanish.
- **Files:** `components/weekly/NewsChrome.tsx`, `app/(public)/items/[id]/page.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed; no tests run.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Reduce footer height and enlarge home content
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · home page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reduced the footer's top gap and padding. Widened the home container and stack, and increased the hero headline, copy, and government-card size.
- **Files:** `components/shell/SiteFooter.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Local `GET /` returns 200.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser visual check wasn't available.

### 2026-10-23: Restore web-push after the local install disappeared
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · local setup
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The package was still absent from `node_modules` despite npm lock metadata. Forced npm to restore `web-push@3.6.7`; package manifests did not change.
- **Files:** `node_modules/web-push` (restored), `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npm ls web-push` shows 3.6.7; local `GET /alerts` now returns 200.
- **Open issues / next:** Reload the browser if the old build-error overlay is still visible.

### 2026-10-23: Install the missing local web-push package
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · local setup
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `web-push` was declared in `package.json` and the lockfile but absent from `node_modules` after pulling. Ran `npm install`; no tracked dependency files changed.
- **Files:** `node_modules/web-push` (installed), `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `npm ls web-push` shows 3.6.7; local `GET /alerts` returns 200.
- **Open issues / next:** None for this error.

### 2026-10-23: Align About content to the page gutter
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · About page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Moved the About content from a centered narrow column to a narrow column aligned with the shared site container and header gutter.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/about/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `git diff --check` passed.
- **Open issues / next:** Visual check wasn't available. The local dev log showed an unrelated missing `web-push` module error while compiling the alerts page.

### 2026-10-23: Fit all results actions on one row
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · results page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reduced horizontal padding on the four results actions from the small-screen breakpoint so they fit together at the width in the screenshot; they can still wrap on narrower screens.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Next.js compiled the change; local `/results` returned 200.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser access was denied earlier, so the row was not visually inspected.

### 2026-10-23: Make result cards link to government details
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · results page interaction
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Removed the separate Details link and made each details-eligible government card a full-card link. Added a hover tint, lift and slight scale, plus the shared arrow cue.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Next.js compiled the change.
- **Open issues / next:** Chrome access was denied, so the hover effect was not visually inspected.

### 2026-10-23: Tighten the results page top spacing
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · results page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reduced the results page's top padding by 24px on desktop and 16px on small screens, keeping its bottom spacing intact.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Next.js compiled the update; local `/results` returned 200.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-23: Configure local lookup environment
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · local setup
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Copied the teammate-provided environment file to ignored `.env.local` with owner-only permissions so the local lookup can reach Supabase and sign its response. No values were added to Git.
- **Files:** `.env.local` (ignored), `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Dev server starts with `.env.local`; `POST /api/lookup` returned 200 and 7 bodies for the non-personal test address `123 Main St, Houston, TX 77004`.
- **Open issues / next:** The test matched Census fallback; the teammate's actual address was not submitted.

### 2026-10-23: Keep the home government stack label on one line
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · home page layout
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The final government-stack card now stays on one line, with a smaller inset on wider screens, no inset on small screens, and slightly smaller text on narrow screens to fit both languages.
- **Files:** `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** The running Next.js server compiled the change.
- **Open issues / next:** Browser UI was unavailable for a visual check. The server log also showed an unrelated `POST /api/lookup` 500; not investigated.

### 2026-10-23: Pulled latest main and started the app locally
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · local setup
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Fast-forwarded local `main` from `e26b379` to `776105f` from `origin/main` and started the Next.js development server.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md` (this entry); the pull brought in the upstream changes listed by Git.
- **Contract changes:** None made locally.
- **Checked:** `git pull --ff-only` succeeded; `npm run dev` reports Next.js 16.4.2 ready at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Open issues / next:** Dev server is running in this session. Turbopack warned that it ignored `/Users/Ishaan/package-lock.json` because it is outside this repository.

### 2026-10-23: Accounts table applied; privacy page covers Google sign-in
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (the P5 steps handed off in sohankamsala's sign-in entry below)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Migration:** I applied `account_profiles` to production. Supabase recorded it as version `20261023140515`, so I renamed the file from `20261022230000_account_profiles.sql` to match, like every other migration. The file name in the sign-in entry below is now out of date.
  - **Types:** I regenerated `account_profiles` in `lib/database.types.ts`, and `lib/account.ts` now uses the typed client.
  - **Privacy page** (both languages, effective Oct 23, 2026):
    - A new "Signing in with Google" section says what's saved: the Google email, name and photo link, kept by Supabase, plus body IDs and stakes, never the address. It also says how to ask for deletion.
    - The cookies text now says government IDs stay about six months and that signing out forgets them, and that readers who sign in get a sign-in cookie too.
    - The processors list adds Supabase and Google for sign-in.
  - **Deploy:** this push also deploys sohankamsala's nine Oct 22 commits, which Vercel had blocked because the repo is private.
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/20261023140515_account_profiles.sql` (renamed), `lib/database.types.ts`, `lib/account.ts`, `app/(public)/privacy/page.tsx`, `messages/{en,es}.json` (`Legal.privacy`), `tests/platform/messages.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** DB schema: `account_profiles` now exists in production, as designed in the sign-in entry below. Tech plan §16 and §19 don't list it yet; the plan files are unchanged.
- **Checked:**
  - The new privacy test failed first, then passed.
  - `npm test` (824 Vitest plus P4's 72), typecheck, lint and `npm run build` pass.
  - Supabase's security check shows only the expected "RLS on, no policies" notice for the new table, the same as every other table.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Google is still off.** The owner still needs to do steps 1–3 of the sign-in entry: the Google Cloud OAuth client, the Supabase provider and the redirect URLs. Then test sign-in on the live site.
  - **Deletion is by request only.** A "Delete my account" button would make it self-service (`auth.admin.deleteUser` cascades to `account_profiles`).

### 2026-10-22: New logo (monogram)
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (the teammate picked it from six options)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The star logo is replaced by a monogram: a heavy Geist "S" on an ink rounded square, with a brick dot.
  - **In the app:** a new `LogoMark` in `components/civic.tsx` (with `light` for dark backgrounds). It's used by `Logo` (site header, app sidebar, onboarding) and by the alerts phone preview.
  - **Icon files:** regenerated from the same design. These are `app/favicon.ico` (16/32/48), `app/apple-icon.png` and `public/icons/icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`. The install icons are full-bleed, with the S inside the maskable safe zone.
- **Files:** `components/civic.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/alerts/alerts.tsx`, `app/favicon.ico`, `app/apple-icon.png`, `public/icons/`, `DESIGN.md`
- **Contract changes:** `LogoMark` is new; `Logo` keeps its props.
- **Checked:** Typecheck, lint and tests pass. I looked at the logo on the site header, the app sidebar and the alerts preview, and at every icon size.
- **Open issues / next:** The Devpost thumbnail and video should use the new mark.

### 2026-10-22: White UI and one font (Geist)
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (the teammate's call; touches P5's design system)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:**
  - **Color:** cream is gone. `--surface` is white, and the page behind the cards (`--canvas`) is a cool light gray (`#F2F3F4`). The derived grays mix with ink instead of brown. Red (`--brick`), blue (`--denim`) and ink are unchanged. In the `/app` shell, the main area is transparent over the gray, so white cards float on it.
  - **Font:** Geist everywhere, replacing Overpass for the app and Playfair Display and Libre Franklin on news surfaces. `font-headline` and `font-news` still exist as class names but point at Geist. The Overpass "Middot Fix" font-face was removed.
- **Files:** `app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `DESIGN.md` (tokens table, type section, checklist), `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes:** Design tokens and fonts changed (DESIGN.md is updated). Anything hard-coded to look right on cream should be rechecked.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test`, including the contrast test, plus lint and typecheck pass.
  - Every screen checked in the browser shows Geist only: `/app`, `/app/timeline`, `/app/brief`, the story sheet, `/weekly` and the home page.
- **Open issues / next:** Template-written stories still show raw headlines like "Vote Oct. 27: ORDINANCE …". `agendaHeadline` only tidies items with no story at all.

### 2026-10-22: Sign in with Google, plus guest mode (no more re-entering the address)
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (the teammate asked for it; touches P5's area)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The home page asked for the address on every visit. The teammate chose Google sign-in plus a guest mode.
  - **Guest mode (works now):** the `showup_bodies` cookie (body IDs only) now lasts 180 days. `/` sends a returning reader straight to `/app`, and "Change address" links to `/?change=1`.
  - **Google sign-in (code ready, provider off):** `/signin` offers "Continue with Google" or "Continue as guest". Routes are `/auth/google`, `/auth/callback` and `/auth/signout`. Signed-in readers get their body IDs and stakes saved to the new `account_profiles` table (never an address), so they follow them to other devices. The callback restores saved governments, or saves the browser's guest ones. Signing out clears the browser's copy. Signing in stays optional (Project_Plan decision 8).
  - **Shell:** the account menu shows the Google name and avatar or "Guest · saved on this browser", with sign-in or sign-out.
  - **Admin safety:** `requireAdmin` now also needs a password sign-in (the JWT's `amr` claim), so a Google session for an allowlisted email can't open `/admin`.
- **Files:** `lib/account.ts` (new), `app/auth/{google,callback,signout}/route.ts` (new), `app/(public)/signin/page.tsx` (new), `app/(public)/page.tsx` (P5's home), `app/(prototype)/app/use/route.ts`, `app/(prototype)/layout.tsx`, `lib/prototype/{profile.tsx,liveData.ts}`, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `lib/adminAuth.ts` (P5's), `proxy.ts` (P5's), `messages/*.json` (`Account`), `supabase/migrations/20261022230000_account_profiles.sql` (new), `tests/platform/adminPassword.test.ts` (new)
- **Contract changes:**
  - **New table:** `account_profiles`, with RLS on and no policies; server only.
  - **Proxy:** now also runs on `/` and `/app/*` to refresh the Supabase session, and it skips when the Supabase keys are missing.
  - **Admin:** requires a password sign-in.
- **Handed off to PlaidMod (P5):** the migration is **not applied**. This machine has no database connection (`SUPABASE_DB_URL` is empty) and isn't on the Vercel team, so these four steps are yours. Until then, guest mode works, the Google button stays hidden, and saving to an account is skipped without errors.
- **To turn Google on (someone with Supabase and Google Cloud access):**
  1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → create a Web OAuth client. Authorized redirect URI: `https://elsvhqqwdxwsuvkbchdq.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
  2. Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google: enable it and paste the client ID and secret.
  3. Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration: add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and `https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app/auth/callback` to the redirect URLs.
  4. Apply the `account_profiles` migration.
  The Google button appears by itself once the provider is on: `googleEnabled()` checks Supabase's auth settings every 5 minutes.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (823), lint and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser, the guest flow works: first visit, lookup, return visit straight to the dashboard, change address. `/signin` shows the "not turned on yet" notice and the guest button.
  - The account menu has "Sign out" for signed-in readers and "Sign out and forget this browser" for guests. Both clear this browser's governments.
  - Google sign-in itself is **not verified**, because the provider is off.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P5:** regenerate `lib/database.types.ts` after the migration (`lib/account.ts` uses an untyped client until then).
  - **P5:** add sign-in to the privacy page: we store the Google account's email and name (Supabase Auth) plus body IDs and stakes.

### 2026-10-22: Story job picks the weekly window first; one manual run
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:**
  - **The job's order:** `supabaseStoryStore.pending` (`lib/stories/job.ts`) never picked the soonest meetings. Its `order(..., { referencedTable: 'meetings' })` only sorts the joined rows, so it chose arbitrary items out of the 643 waiting. It now takes items in the weekly window first (7 days back to 14 ahead): upcoming meetings soonest first, then the past week, then anything else.
  - **Manual run:** with the teammate's go-ahead, I ran `/api/cron/stories` once from a local server against the production database. It wrote 10 stories (9 AI that passed the code fact-check, 1 template, 0 failed), all for HISD's Oct 22 meeting. Most of those are closed-session items, and their stories use "an employee" as required.
- **Files:** `lib/stories/job.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Typecheck, lint and the story tests (28) pass. I listed the written stories from the database afterwards.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - About 114 window items still need stories (66 City Council, 38 MUD 489, 19 CFISD). The cron writes 10 per run.
  - Closed-session items get stories even though they show only on the timeline tier. Skipping them in `pending` would save credits; that's a team call.

### 2026-10-22: Photos on the weekly brief, readable agenda titles on real data
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** I checked `/app/timeline` and `/app/brief` against the real database (local env, an address lookup, then "Open your dashboard"). Both show real Houston agenda items.
  - **Brief photos:** each bento tile now has its government's photo under a veil of the tile color. "Also decided" stories have a photo thumbnail. Photos come from `lib/bodyPhotos.ts`, with credits shown.
  - **Readable titles:** real items have no stories yet, so cards showed raw titles like "ORDINANCE finding and determining that…". `lib/weekly/agendaTitle.ts` makes a card headline from the official wording. The leading document type becomes a tag ("Ordinance"), the headline stops at the first clause, and all-caps names are put in normal case. Nothing is reworded; the full official title is the story sheet's summary, next to the source link. Written stories replace this automatically.
- **Files:** `lib/weekly/agendaTitle.ts` (new), `tests/weekly/agendaTitle.test.ts` (new), `lib/prototype/live.ts`, `lib/prototype/types.ts` (`docKind`), `app/(prototype)/app/brief/page.tsx`, `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** `Update` (`lib/prototype/types.ts`) gains an optional `docKind`.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (822), lint and typecheck pass. Both pages loaded with real data in the browser, with no console errors.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Stories:** none of these real items have a written story (`story_en` is null). The story job runs from `/api/cron/alerts`. I didn't run it by hand, because it writes to the production database and uses AI credits.
  - **Photos:** every City Council item shows the same City Hall photo. A few more photos per body would add variety.

### 2026-10-22: Scroll motion on the timeline (Motion library)
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commits; not pushed)
- **What changed:** On `/app/timeline`, tiles slide in from their own side as they scroll up (72px), grow from 88% and untilt from 3°, while each photo moves against the scroll (about 150px of travel). Everything is tied to scroll position, so it reverses when you scroll back, and nothing moves with reduced motion. Two lighter CSS-only versions earlier today were too subtle to notice, so this replaces them.
- **New dependency:** `motion` 13.5.1 (motion.dev, pinned exact). It's used only in the timeline page so far. `npm install` also rewrote some `libc` lines in `package-lock.json`, which is npm-version noise.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (`timeline.module.css` from earlier today was removed)
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - Lint, typecheck and tests pass.
  - In Chromium, the tile and photo transforms change as you scroll, and with reduced motion they stay at rest.
  - No horizontal scroll at 320–1440px while scrolling: the timeline column clips sideways overflow.
- **Open issues / next:** Not checked in Firefox or Safari. Motion's scroll tracking supports both.

### 2026-10-22: New timeline layout with photos, motion and a hideable sidebar
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** `/app/timeline` has a new layout (the teammate reviewed five static previews and approved this one). The data and behavior are the same as before.
  - **Layout:**
    - **Left:** the count of chances to weigh in this week (counts up), a "This week's big idea" memo (the week's lead story from `buildWeekly`, or the most urgent item), and topic filters.
    - **Center:** a timeline line with day headings. Photo tiles alternate sides; coming-up items run soonest first, then decided items show as compact rows with their result. Tiles load 6 at a time as you scroll and end with "You're all caught up".
    - **Right:** a live countdown to the next sign-up deadline, and quick actions. The government on/off switches moved here, folding open.
  - **Motion:** tiles fade and rise in as they scroll into view; the left column has a staged entrance 100ms apart; the line fills in as you scroll; tiles lift on hover; buttons press to 0.96. Everything uses CSS transitions; with reduced motion it's opacity only.
  - **Sidebar:** hidden on the timeline so the page uses the full screen. A › button in the top bar brings it back, and it's hidden again on the next visit. Other pages are unchanged. I also fixed "Change address" being highlighted on every page.
  - **Photos:** six real Houston photos from Wikimedia Commons (free licenses), in `public/photos/`. `lib/bodyPhotos.ts` picks one by government (City Hall, HISD headquarters, the 1910 courthouse, Brays Bayou) or by kind, with a skyline fallback. Each tile shows the photo credit. These are not article photos; news images were dropped earlier.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/timeline/page.tsx`, `components/prototype/reveal.tsx` (new), `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `lib/bodyPhotos.ts` (new), `public/photos/`, `messages/*.json` (`AppTimeline`)
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (817), lint and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser at 1440, 1024, 390 and 320px, in demo and live mode: no horizontal scroll and no console errors.
  - More tiles load on scroll, the sidebar hides and reopens, and reduced motion shows everything without movement.
  - Spanish has no missing messages.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P5:** the sidebar toggle's label is English, like the rest of the shell.
  - **Photo licenses:** the CC BY-SA photo (courthouse) requires that adapted copies share the license. We only resized it. Swap it for another photo if the team would rather not.

### 2026-10-22: Browser notifications live on production
- **Who:** PlaidMod · helping P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Added `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (sensitive) and `VAPID_SUBJECT` to Vercel for Production and Preview. They're the same pair as `.env.local`.
  - Pushed `2794362` (the feature) and `004d0b9`. The second makes the sign-up route log why a confirmation failed, with the status or reason only and never the push address. The sender now keeps the reason for errors that never reached the push service.
- **Files:** `lib/push/send.ts`, `app/api/alerts/push/route.ts`, their tests, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:**
  - Live site: `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/icons/icon-192.png` and `/sw.js` return 200. `sw.js` has the no-cache and CSP headers, and `/alerts` carries the public key.
  - The first live sign-up (deploy `c0sm6t2ef`) saved, but its confirmation never showed. That deploy didn't log the reason. A test send from the local keys to the same subscription arrived, so the subscription and keys were fine.
  - On deploy `khriytob3`, two off-and-on cycles each showed the confirmation; the second took 1.6 s from the click. No failure was logged.
  - The test sign-up was turned off; the users, user_bodies, alert_queue and alerts_sent tables have 0 rows.
- **Open issues / next:** The first missed confirmation is unexplained. If it happens again, `vercel logs` shows `push confirmation failed: …`. Still untested: a real alert from the daily job (no item qualifies today), and iPhone or Safari.

### 2026-10-22: Alerts go out as browser notifications (Twilio dropped)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · helping P3 News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Twilio requires the account owner's ID verification, which the team declined, and carrier registration takes days. Alerts now also go out as Web Push browser notifications: the same rules, quiet hours, once-only sending, reminders 7a/7b and protest reminder. The app signs them with its own keys, so no outside account is needed. The texting code is unchanged and off; text sign-up still shows a labeled preview.
  - **Sign-up:** a new "Browser notifications" panel sits above "Text messages" on `/app/alerts` and `/alerts` (`components/alerts/PushSignup.tsx`). It uses the same consent and under-18 parent rule as texts. `POST /api/alerts/push` saves the subscription with the reader's governments, sets `showup_sub` and sends a confirmation. `DELETE` deletes the row.
  - **Sending:** `runAlertsJob` takes an optional `push` sender, and `/api/cron/alerts` passes it when the `VAPID_*` keys are set. Expired subscriptions (404/410) are deleted. Only Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft push hosts are accepted.
  - **iPhone:** `app/manifest.ts`, Home Screen icons and `public/sw.js` (shows notifications only, no caching).
  - **Copy:** "Text alerts" became "Alerts" in the nav, page titles, why-page and links (EN/ES). The privacy and terms pages name the push services. Both pages' effective date is now Oct 22.
- **Files:** `lib/push/*`, `lib/sms/{job,schedule,eligibility,message,subscribers,types,http}.ts`, `app/api/alerts/push/route.ts`, `app/api/cron/alerts/route.ts`, `components/alerts/PushSignup.tsx`, both alerts pages, `components/prototype/app-shell.tsx`, `app/manifest.ts`, `app/apple-icon.png`, `public/{sw.js,icons/}`, `next.config.ts` (sw.js headers), `messages/*.json`, `lib/env.ts`, `.env.example`, `supabase/migrations/20261022201640_push_alerts.sql` (applied), `lib/database.types.ts`, `package.json` (`web-push`), tests in `tests/push/`, `tests/sms/`, `tests/api/push-route.test.ts`. Docs: both plan files, `.plans/p3-twilio-registration.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/{readiness,project-pace,testing-checklist}.md`.
- **Contract changes:** DB schema: `users` gains `push_endpoint` (unique), `push_p256dh` and `push_auth`, all set or all null (§16). `AlertUser` gains an optional `push`. `AlertsJobResult` gains `removed`. `reminderText` output is unchanged, now built from the shared `reminderSentence`.
- **Checked:**
  - Tests: `npm test` passes (815 Vitest + 72 P4 tests). Typecheck, lint and `npm run build` are clean. New tests were watched failing first.
  - Local built app in Chromium, City Hall lookup: turning notifications on returned 200, and the confirmation arrived through Google's push service and was shown by the service worker. The database got 1 row with no phone, following 7 governments. Turning off removed the row, its governments and the cookie, and the tables are back to 0.
  - The alerts store's reads work on the real schema.
  - `/alerts` in Spanish at 390px has no sideways scroll.
  - Supabase security advisors show nothing new.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Vercel:** the three `VAPID_*` keys are in `.env.local` only. Until they're added to Vercel (production and preview, the same pair), the live page shows the notifications preview.
  - No upcoming item is in the alert tier today, so the daily job (16:00 UTC) has nothing to send. A real alert, beyond the confirmation, hasn't been seen yet.
  - Not tested on a real iPhone or in Safari.
  - **For P4:** Speak up's labels still say "SMS reminder" (`speak.saveReminder`, `speak.reminderNote`). Reminders now also reach notification subscribers through `showup_sub`; consider "reminder."
  - The `/alerts/why` route and `?why=` links keep their names; only the visible wording changed.

### 2026-10-21: HCAD data for 6 more ZIPs (30 in all)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (P1's lookup data)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Ran the HCAD slice workflow (run 39703086677) for 77020, 77022 and 77026 (City of Houston, HISD) and 77040, 77041 and 77064 (Cypress-Fairbanks). Loaded 78,164 parcels; 536 with no tax codes were skipped. That makes 385,337 parcels and 3,435,567 tax-code rows in 30 ZIPs. The local slice is deleted. No code changed.
- **Files:** `docs/p1-data-loading.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:**
  - The new totals equal the earlier ones plus exactly what the workflow staged.
  - By school district, the new parcels are CFISD 41,187, HISD 35,093, Aldine ISD 1,700, and under 200 in other districts.
  - Live, 40 random new addresses: all gave `match: hcad`; 36 got the HISD or CFISD board. A second live sample of 30: all 30 got a board.
  - Local dev server, 110 random new addresses: 106 got a board. 3 are in Aldine ISD or Spring Branch ISD, which we don't track, and are listed as not tracked. 1 was "not found": a street address shared by several accounts, sent without a ZIP (the known test-format case in the entry below).
- **Space:** the quota is at 435 MB of 500. The tax-code index grew from 107 MB back to 156 MB.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Don't load more ZIPs without freeing space first. An average ZIP adds about 16 MB; another index rebuild (the two runs in `docs/p1-data-loading.md`) would return about 20 MB.
  - **For P1:** HCAD code `012`, HOUSTON ISD (FORMERLY NFISD), isn't in `data/hcad-jurisdiction-map.yaml`. No loaded parcel has it, but in ZIPs where it appears the lookup would list it as untracked instead of showing the HISD board. Source-check it and add it to the map before loading those ZIPs.

### 2026-10-21: Rebuilt the HCAD tax-code index (48 MB freed)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (P1's lookup data)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Index.** PlaidMod rebuilt `hcad_jurisdictions_pkey` in the Supabase SQL editor. The primary key was dropped, then added back in a separate run with the migration's definition, `(account, hcad_code)`. A plain `REINDEX` was ruled out because it keeps the old index until the new one is built, and the quota would have peaked near 499 MB. No schema change.
  - **Space.** The index went from 155 MB to 107 MB. The quota total went from 386 MB to 338 MB of 500.
  - **Log fix.** A merge on Oct 19 (`50aae75`) had pasted a second copy of this file's header into the P5 Task 8 (`bodies_token`) entry, which cut off its ID-format line. The copy is removed and the line restored from before the merge. Nothing else in that entry changed.
- **Files:** `docs/p1-data-loading.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:**
  - The primary key is valid, and the 2,760,722 rows are unchanged.
  - The lookup's join uses an index-only scan on the new key.
  - Live: 20 random loaded addresses all gave `match: hcad`. 901 Bagby St gives `hcad` with 7 governments and 3 untracked, the same as before.
  - Disk: about 800 MB of 1 GB. 464 MB of that is the write-ahead log, mostly spare files that Postgres reuses.
- **Correction:** The entry below says 371 MB of 500. That figure was the main database only. The quota counts all the project's databases, including Postgres's two template databases (7 MB each), so the total was 386 MB.
- **Open issues / next:** There's room for about 6 more ZIPs of average size, about 13,000 parcels each. That's an estimate: new loads grow the index faster than the table. To reclaim the space later, repeat the two-run rebuild in `docs/p1-data-loading.md`.

### 2026-10-21: HCAD data for 14 more ZIPs; HCAD matches no longer need a map point
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (P1's lookup data and route)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **More ZIPs.** Ran the HCAD slice workflow (run 39686003192) for 77009, 77011, 77018, 77023, 77025, 77027, 77030, 77054, 77056 and 77096 (City of Houston, HISD), plus 77065, 77070, 77095 and 77429 (Cypress-Fairbanks). Loaded 164,767 parcels; 1,379 with no tax codes were skipped. That makes 307,173 parcels in 24 ZIPs. The local slice is deleted.
  - **Space.** The database is at 371 MB of the 500 MB free-plan limit, so don't load many more ZIPs. The tax-code index is 155 MB, bigger than its table, because later loads insert between existing accounts.
  - **Route fix.** An HCAD match with no map point used to return 404 "We could not resolve a location for that parcel." That happened whenever the Census couldn't place the address, because the slice loads no parcel points. Tech plan §5 step 4 says "not found" is only for when neither source matches, so the route now answers from the tax codes and skips only the boundary check (no boundaries are loaded anyway).
- **Files:** `app/api/lookup/route.ts`, `tests/api/lookup-route.test.ts`, `docs/p1-data-loading.md`
- **Contract changes (P1):** P1's test "rejects a parcel without any valid Census or HCAD coordinates" is replaced by "confirms an HCAD match the Census cannot place". The response shape is unchanged.
- **Checked:**
  - The new test failed with the old 404, then passed.
  - Shared addresses: 6,571 confirmed and 95 use the Census answer (up from 49, as more ZIPs share street addresses).
  - Live, before the fix: 40 random new addresses gave 34 HCAD-confirmed, 1 Census and 5 with the 404 above. Big campuses and malls (TMC, Galleria, Willowbrook) aren't filed in HCAD under their public street address, so they use the Census answer.
  - Live, after the fix: 40 random loaded addresses gave 37 HCAD-confirmed, 1 Census and 2 "not found". The 2 were sent as "<street>, Houston, TX" with no ZIP, so the Census couldn't place them, and they sit at addresses whose accounts disagree on tracked codes. With a real city and ZIP they get the Census answer.
  - Offline, 2,000 stored addresses all survive the lookup's normalization unchanged. 95 addresses (5,077 parcels, 1.65%) have accounts that disagree on tracked codes; the largest has 1,194 accounts.
- **Open issues / next:** More ZIPs need space first: drop unneeded rows or rebuild the index while there's room.

### 2026-10-21: Lookup fix, part 4: live site switched to the fixed build
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** PlaidMod promoted `showup-fqf2bmerz` (commit `79f4f91`) to production. The rollback pin to `showup-kljzsrb88` from the entries below no longer applies. No code changed.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked (on https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app):**
  - `/api/lookup`: 901 Bagby St and 10707 Mason Rd give `match: hcad` with the same governments as the local test. Pasadena City Hall gives `match: census` and lists Pasadena City Council and Pasadena ISD as not tracked.
  - At 390 px: `/results` shows "Address match verified" with no sideways scroll. "Open your dashboard" turns `/app` to real data with no "Sample data". The downtown address shows 7 governments and 52 things this week.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - The Cypress-area address shows 0 things this week. Its bodies have no upcoming meetings in the database yet (latest: CFISD and MUD 489 Oct 19, Commissioners Court Oct 15, Lone Star Oct 1). The 3-hourly ingest runs are succeeding, so they should appear once the agendas are posted (P2).
  - Opening `/app` directly, without the dashboard link, still shows the demo. That's by design.
  - Promoting a build ends the rollback, so pushes to `main` go live on their own again (Vercel's "Undo a rollback" docs). Teammates' commits still wait for the owner's approval.

### 2026-10-21: Verify OpenRouter, correct coach timing claims and assess deadline pace
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 / release verification
- **Branch:** main, based on `79f4f91`
- **What changed:** Tested both configured models and the real coach route through OpenRouter. Live review caught a practice target being described as an official limit and incorrect generated duration prose. Preserved limit verification in the API/model context and made bilingual timing feedback deterministic. Added regression tests, the live results report and a dated owner-by-owner pace assessment; refreshed readiness and the testing guide. User requested commit/push of this work.
- **Files:** `app/api/coach/route.ts`, `lib/coach/{types,shared,service}.ts`, `tests/{coach/integration.test.ts,p4/coach.test.mjs}`, `docs/{openrouter-verification,project-pace,readiness,p4-status,testing-checklist}.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** Internal `CoachItem.minutesVerified` is optional; unknown official minutes are null in provider context, with a separate practice target. Public response schema and database contracts are unchanged.
- **Checked:** Three new timing regressions and the strengthened integration assertion failed before the fix and pass afterward. Fresh full suite: 786 Vitest + 72 P4 (858), lint, typecheck and production build pass; initial full run hit the existing ESLint isolation timeout, then passed on rerun. Independent review found no blocking issue. Both `gemini-3.8-flash` and `gemini-4-argon` return structured JSON via OpenRouter. Ten post-fix EN/ES coach cases all return provider feedback with correct timing/practice labels, exact quotes and no-store; 5.9–12.5s, no local fallback. Twenty coach calls total across before/after checks may exhaust the local shared hourly allowance. No key values printed or edited; no SMS, quiz answers, registrations/comments, ingest or admin mutations submitted.
- **Open issues / next:** Core software works, but planned evidence/demo acceptance is behind: 636 of 646 items need stories, zero coverage/demo-cache rows, tax rates empty and one quiz response of unknown provenance. P4 must verify a current real participation route (Oct 22 HISD hearing is not confirmed open public comment), finish meeting-specific checks and retain real participation evidence. Other owners: stories/coverage, tax data, consenting SMS acceptance, demo/video/submission. Official Devpost deadline is Oct 24 00:00 CDT, after Friday night; older CST label is inaccurate. Legacy address storage and shell translation remain open. Plan stress test remains pending under the existing P4 implementation-spec exception.


### 2026-10-21: Pull current lookup and ingest work; refresh P4 test guide
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 / integration verification
- **Branch:** main, fast-forwarded from `1e46631` to `79f4f91`
- **What changed:** Read the lookup, ingest, review and provider handoffs. Preserved the local October 20 audit in a recovery stash, resolved its handoff-only conflict, and replaced outdated readiness claims with current evidence. Added a full testing checklist with P4 steps, EN/ES coaching cases, public addresses and expected results; refreshed P4 status.
- **Files:** `docs/testing-checklist.md`, `docs/readiness.md`, `docs/p4-status.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None; no product code or environment changes.
- **Checked:** 786 Vitest + 69 P4 tests (855), lint, typecheck and production build pass. First test run hit the existing ESLint isolation timeout; full rerun passed. Live reads: 11 bodies, 7 sources, 6 meetings, 646 items, 142,406 parcels; tax_rates and demo_cache empty. City Hall and Bridgeland HS return HCAD matches; TSU returns Census fallback. Built cron routes reject with 401, review redirects to login, and coach rejects malformed/cross-origin input with 400/403 and no-store. Spanish 390px City Hall results and real P4 flow have no horizontal overflow; Wednesday Council registration stays unknown, synthetic draft restores, practice renders, and the real-item redirect works. No quiz/provider/SMS/admin/ingest or official participation actions performed; lookup uses normal quota bookkeeping.
- **Open issues / next:** OpenRouter and Twilio remain absent in this local env despite P5's owner/deployment setup; privately obtain current config. Finish live EN/ES evaluation and authentic participation. Legacy `/start` still persists the address, shell text remains partly English, and the root palette swapper is absent. Production promotion and tax/demo data remain owner work; see readiness. No commit or push.

### 2026-10-21: Lookup fix, parts 2–3: HCAD data for 10 ZIPs loaded; shared addresses resolved
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (P1's lookup data and RPC, decided by PlaidMod)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **HCAD data without a laptop download.** New workflow `.github/workflows/hcad-slice.yml` (run by hand). GitHub's runner downloads HCAD's 2026 property files, keeps only the chosen ZIPs and the allowed columns (account, street address, legal description, tax codes; no owner, mail or value fields), dry-runs the loader, and uploads a 4.2 MB private artifact kept for 3 days. Run 39546716606 produced it. I loaded it from this computer with `npm run load:hcad -- --apply`.
  - **Loaded:** 142,406 parcels and 1,285,421 tax-code rows for ZIPs 77002, 77003, 77004, 77006, 77007, 77008, 77019, 77021, 77098 and 77433. The database is 159 MB of 500.
    - 1,853 accounts had no tax codes and were skipped.
    - 1 malformed row in HCAD's countywide file was skipped (`ff75cbc`).
    - Also seeded: P1's body catalog (11 rows; same IDs and texting flags as before, P1's names) and the jurisdiction map (9 codes). All 646 agenda items are unchanged.
  - **Loader and staging:** parcel points are optional (the lookup uses the Census point). `load:hcad` now keeps shared addresses and unmapped codes and skips parcels with no codes (`planHcadLoad`).
  - **Shared street addresses (condos, and one street address in two ZIPs):**
    - New migration `20261021050753_hcad_lookup_code_sets.sql`, applied. `lookup_hcad_parcel` returns one account per different tax-code set at an address, instead of the first 2 accounts. Before this, 219 addresses could get the wrong answer.
    - The route confirms an address when all its accounts share the same *tracked* codes, and lists only the untracked governments every account shares. When tracked codes differ it uses the Census answer instead of returning "not found".
    - Result: 3,750 of 3,799 shared addresses are confirmed; 49 use the Census answer.
  - **Names:**
    - Codes with no name in HCAD's public list are no longer shown. Ten such codes appear in these ZIPs; "HCAD tax code 888" told readers nothing.
    - HCAD abbreviations are spelled out ("Houston Downtown Management District").
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/hcad-slice.yml`, `scripts/{stage-hcad,load-hcad}.ts`, `lib/lookup/{hcadStaging,hcadSource,uncovered}.ts`, `app/api/lookup/route.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20261021050753_hcad_lookup_code_sets.sql`, `docs/p1-data-loading.md`, `tests/lookup/{hcadStaging,uncovered}.test.ts`, `tests/api/lookup-route.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (P1):**
  - `lookup_hcad_parcel` keeps its signature and columns, but its rows now mean "one per tax-code set", with no row limit. `lib/database.types.ts` is unchanged.
  - `uncoveredFromHcadCode` returns `null` for unnamed codes.
  - The route reads the whole `jurisdiction_map` up front.
  - P1's shared-address test now expects the Census answer, not a 404.
- **Checked:**
  - New tests failed first, then passed. `npm test`: 786 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - Built app against the real database:
    - 901 Bagby St (City Hall, 77002) is confirmed by HCAD, with 7 tracked governments plus the Hospital District, Department of Education and Downtown Management District.
    - 10707 Mason Rd (Bridgeland HS, 77433) is confirmed with CFISD, Lone Star and MUD 489, plus WCID 157, WCID 159 and ESD 9.
    - 3100 Cleburne St (TSU, 77004) has no exact HCAD street match, so it uses the Census answer.
    - Pasadena City Hall is outside the loaded ZIPs, so it uses the Census answer.
  - In the browser at 390 px: `/results` shows "Address match verified" for every body with no sideways scroll, and `/app` shows real City Council and HISD items with no "Sample data".
  - The Supabase security check shows nothing new.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Production is still pinned to `showup-kljzsrb88` and needs promoting to a build with these changes.
  - Other ZIPs: rerun the workflow with the full list.
  - Boundaries (GIS) aren't loaded and aren't needed for the lookup.
  - ESDs, WCIDs and the countywide Hospital District and Department of Education are listed but not tracked.

### 2026-10-21: Lookup fix, part 1: never fails on governments we don't track; Census fallback
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (changes to P1's lookup, decided by PlaidMod)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Fixes problems 1 and 3–7 from the review entry below.
  - **Unknown governments:** HCAD codes with no curated body (043 Hospital District, 044 Department of Education, ESDs, other ISDs and cities) and Census places or districts outside the catalog no longer fail the lookup. They're listed in a new `uncovered` array by official name, typed for the quiz, and are never put in the token.
    - Names come from HCAD's public list, in `data/hcad-jurisdictions.json` (708 codes, names only; regenerate with `npx tsx scripts/fetch-hcad-jurisdictions.ts`).
    - The helpers are in `lib/lookup/uncovered.ts`.
  - **No HCAD parcel loaded:** the lookup falls back to the Census answer (city, school district, college district, and the countywide governments), sets `match: 'census'`, and puts every listed body in the token so the dashboard works. `/results` labels these "From the Census, not yet confirmed" and explains why.
  - **Several accounts at one address** (condos) are accepted when their tax codes match.
  - CenterPoint is listed once.
  - **The quiz:** `/api/quiz` also counts `uncovered_types`, which `BodyQuiz` now sends.
- **Files:** `app/api/lookup/route.ts`, `lib/contracts/lookup.ts`, `lib/lookup/uncovered.ts`, `data/hcad-jurisdictions.json`, `scripts/fetch-hcad-jurisdictions.ts`, `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `app/api/quiz/route.ts`, `components/flow/BodyQuiz.tsx`, `messages/{en,es}.json` (`Results`), `tests/api/{lookup,quiz}-route.test.ts`, `tests/lookup/uncovered.test.ts`, `tests/platform/lookupState.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** `LookupResponse` gains `match: 'hcad' | 'census'` and `uncovered: LookupUncovered[]`. P1's tests that encoded fail-closed behavior now encode PlaidMod's decisions (list instead of fail; Census fallback).
- **Checked:**
  - The new tests failed first, then passed. `npm test`: 781 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - The built app against the real database (no HCAD data loaded yet):
    - 901 Bagby St gives `match: census` with 7 bodies, plus the Hospital District and Department of Education as uncovered.
    - Pasadena City Hall gives the countywide bodies, with Pasadena City Council and Pasadena ISD listed as uncovered.
  - In the browser, `/results` (Spanish, 390 px) shows the Census note, the "other governments" list and one CenterPoint, with no sideways scroll. The quiz wasn't submitted, to keep test rows out of `quiz_responses`.
- **Open issues / next:** Part 2 loads HCAD data for 10 ZIPs (77002, 77003, 77004, 77006, 77007, 77008, 77019, 77021, 77098, 77433) through a GitHub Actions run, so the big files never touch a laptop. `load:hcad` still refuses unknown codes and needs the same change. Production stays pinned to `showup-kljzsrb88` until the lookup is verified with real data.

### 2026-10-21: Review of P1's new lookup: problems not in P1's notes
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform (review of `e26b379`, `app/api/lookup/route.ts` and `lib/lookup/`)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Docs only. These problems are on top of the open items P1 already listed (credentials, data loading, demo addresses, the unmapped-code decision). PlaidMod (P5) is fixing these next, so P1 doesn't need to.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None yet.
- **Checked:** Static review. HCAD's official code list was checked at `public.hcad.org/resources/jurlist.asp` on Oct 21. A local run against the real database returned 500 for 901 Bagby St (no HCAD data loaded).
- **Open issues / next, most severe first:**
  1. **Every real address fails.** Codes 043 (HARRIS COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICT) and 044 (HARRIS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION) are countywide, so they should appear on every parcel (worth confirming against one real record). Neither is in `data/hcad-jurisdiction-map.yaml`, and any unmapped code throws "Some local taxing jurisdictions are not configured yet".
  2. **Unincorporated addresses fail.** They carry an ESD code (for example 633 = ESD 9, 640 = ESD 14), none is mapped, and the catalog has no ESD bodies. MUD 489 is unincorporated, so the demo MUD address would fail.
  3. **Anywhere outside Houston, HISD and CFISD fails with a 500 "Try again later".** Unmapped ISD and city codes cause it, and so do Census hints such as `katy_isd_board` or `pasadena_city_council` that aren't in the 11-entry catalog. Retrying can't help, and the classmate survey would hit this for most other addresses.
  4. **Only addresses whose HCAD data is loaded work.** P1 plans to load only the demo ZIP codes (the 500 MB limit), and there's no fallback. The previous Census-only lookup worked countywide.
  5. **Condos and townhomes fail.** Unit numbers are stripped, so several accounts share one key, and two or more matches throw "could not match that address to one parcel". These accounts normally have the same tax codes.
  6. **CenterPoint appears twice** once the catalog is seeded: it's hard-coded in the route and also read from `bodies` (`category: not_government`), giving duplicate cards and React keys.
  7. **The real reason never reaches the screen.** `components/flow/LookupProvider.tsx` (P5) keeps only the error code, so coverage gaps show as a generic server error.
  - P1's route tests mock a database in which every code is mapped, so none of these show up in the tests.

### 2026-10-21: P1's lookup migration applied; database types regenerated
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Applied P1's `p1_lookup_support` migration to Supabase. It recorded as version `20261021040012`, so I renamed the file from `20261020160000_p1_lookup_support.sql` to match. P1's entries that use the old name are out of date.
  - The migration adds `tax_rates.last_vote_date` and the service-role-only functions `load_hcad_batch`, `replace_hcad_boundary_layer`, `lookup_hcad_parcel`, `lookup_boundary_bodies` and `lookup_hoa_candidates`.
  - `lib/database.types.ts` now has the new column and functions, matching Supabase's generated types.
  - `docs/p1-data-loading.md` names the new file.
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/20261021040012_p1_lookup_support.sql` (renamed), `lib/database.types.ts`, `docs/p1-data-loading.md`
- **Contract changes:** As in P1's entries: the new `tax_rates` column and the five functions. No new tables.
- **Checked:**
  - The migration applied cleanly. Its tables and columns were checked against `core.sql` first.
  - SQL: 0 tables without RLS, 0 policies. All five functions are `security invoker`, `anon` and `authenticated` can't execute them, and `service_role` can.
  - The security advisor shows nothing new (only the expected "RLS enabled, no policy" notices and the leaked-password setting).
  - `npm test`: 772 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck and lint pass.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Production is pinned to `showup-kljzsrb88`** (a Vercel rollback after `3fc2599`). P1's new lookup still returns 500 for every address, because the HCAD parcels, `jurisdiction_map` and boundaries are empty. Promote a newer deploy only once the lookup works against the real database.
  - **For P1:**
    - run `npm run seed:bodies` and the HCAD / boundary loaders (`docs/p1-data-loading.md`)
    - pick the two demo addresses
    - get the team's decision on unmapped HCAD codes (fail closed vs. "other taxing unit")
  - P1 needs a copy of `.env.local`; ask PlaidMod privately.

### 2026-10-21: OpenRouter key is live; the Gemini key is gone
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`:** set in the owner's `.env.local` and on Vercel (production and preview, stored as sensitive).
  - **Removed:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, from both.
  - **Live site:** redeployed. Every AI call (P2 extraction and news links, P3 stories and coverage, P4 coach) now goes through OpenRouter.
  - **Repo:** `.env.example` marks the Gemini-direct lines "not used"; `CLAUDE.md` says the key is set; `scripts/gemini-smoke.ts` now reports "OpenRouter" when that key is set.
- **Files:** `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None. Teammates' local `.env.local` copies need the new key; ask PlaidMod for it privately. Leave the Gemini lines blank.
- **Checked:**
  - The key is valid and on a paid plan, with a $10 spending cap.
  - With the Gemini key hidden from the process, these calls all worked: `generateJson` with `gemini-3.8-flash` and with `gemini-4-argon` (D17's fallback, which Vertex doesn't serve), and P2's `geminiFromEnv()` client.
  - After the redeploy, `/api/coach` answered from the AI (`provider: gemini`), and `/api/cron/stories` wrote 10 stories (9 AI, 1 template, 0 failed).
  - Cost so far: $0.08, about 0.8¢ a story.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - About 540 items still need stories. At 10 per run that takes many runs, and roughly $4–5 of the $10 cap. Raise the key's limit on OpenRouter if agenda reading and coverage also need room.
  - P3: putting upcoming meetings first in the story queue is still open (see the P2 Phase 2 part 1 entry).

### 2026-10-20: Pull OpenRouter changes and audit remaining readiness
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 / integration audit
- **Branch:** main, clean fast-forward through `1e46631`
- **What changed:** Read the new provider/privacy/IP-limit handoffs and checked the root app against live table counts and actual routes. Added `docs/readiness.md` with prioritized owners, evidence needed and the legacy `/start` address-storage mismatch. No product-code or credential changes.
- **Files:** `docs/readiness.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** 650 Vitest + 69 P4 tests (719), lint, typecheck and production build pass. Initial isolation-test timeout passed on the next full run. Built privacy/terms/Speak pages return 200; Spanish privacy text includes OpenRouter and coach cookie. Alerts cron rejects unauthorized requests (401); ingest and review routes return 404. Supabase reads succeed; ten civic/demo tables checked are empty.
- **Open issues / next:** Priorities: persisted ingestion and seeded data; real P1 lookup/quiz/tax receipt; OpenRouter key and live model checks; Twilio or explicit preview; review route; wired demo replay; evidence. Local provider remains Gemini-direct because the OpenRouter key is absent. `/start` still persists the address despite privacy copy. Deployment settings were not independently checked. No messages, submissions, writes to civic data, commit or push performed.

### 2026-10-20: P2 Phase 2, part 3: review queue, 3-hourly schedule, pitch line for D37
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, for P2
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **`/admin/review`** (spec P2-E, minimal): pending items with the quote, a "scanned, quote unverified" banner, the official source link, and Approve and Reject. Reject also sets tier `timeline`. A source health panel sits on top. Logic lives in `lib/review.ts`, and every action calls `requireAdmin()` and updates only rows that are still pending.
  - **`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`:** calls `/api/cron/ingest` every 3 hours, plus a manual run with an optional source and mode.
  - **Health fix:** `health()` no longer flags the manual source for having no meetings.
- **Files:** `app/admin/review/{page,actions}.tsx|ts`, `lib/review.ts`, `messages/{en,es}.json` (`Admin.review`), `lib/ingest/health.ts`, `.github/workflows/ingest.yml`, `.plans/scraper-progress.md`, `tests/platform/review.test.ts`, `tests/unit/health.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - The new tests failed first, then passed.
  - `npm test`: 721 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass, with no tracing warnings.
  - In the browser, `/admin/review` redirects to the login page when signed out (307). Signed in, it shows the health panel and an empty queue (no item needs review right now) in Spanish, with no sideways scroll at 390 px.
  - Approve and Reject weren't clicked against live data: the database edit that would have created a test item was blocked, so they're covered by unit tests only.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **The owner should approve this replacement for the pitch answer in spec §12.22:** "For news sites we follow each site's robots.txt, name our bot, show only short quotes with links, and never get around paywalls. Government agendas are public records, so we fetch them even where a portal's robots.txt asks general crawlers to stay out (Houston's PrimeGov portal, Lone Star College's PDFs). We name our bot, wait between requests, check a few times a day, and link every item to the official source."
  - Disable the GitHub schedule after Oct 23.
  - **Not built:** review Edit and notices, the "Run now" button, the news read route, and the `news_articles` migration.

### 2026-10-20: P2 Phase 2, part 2: scheduled ingest route
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, for P2
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **New route `GET`/`POST /api/cron/ingest`** (spec P2-C). It runs `runScheduled` (`lib/ingest/scheduled.ts`) within 270 s:
    1. seed
    2. near-term sweep of every source (BoardBook skipped 00:00–05:00 Central; AI sources read at most 1 new document)
    3. rotation of the oldest-checked source
    4. results for up to 3 past meetings
    5. more rotation while time remains, at most one AI source per call
  - **Query options:** `?source=<id>&mode=rotation|near_term|results&meetings=a,b` runs one source.
  - **Auth and output:** it requires `CRON_SECRET` and returns counts and flags only. Vercel's daily cron already points here (`vercel.json`).
  - **Bundling:** `next.config.ts` ships `data/sources.yaml` and `data/manual/` with the route. Ignore comments on the two run-time file reads (`lib/adapters/manual.ts`, `lib/ingest/registry.ts`) stop Turbopack tracing the whole project: 681 traced files down to 151.
- **Files:** `app/api/cron/ingest/route.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `lib/adapters/manual.ts`, `lib/ingest/registry.ts`, `tests/unit/ingest-route.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None. The route path matches `vercel.json`.
- **Checked:**
  - The route tests failed first, then passed.
  - `npm test`: 715 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass, and the build shows no tracing warnings.
  - Part 1 is live: for 901 Bagby St, `/api/weekly` returns a City Council lead plus 6 coming up, with PrimeGov source links.
- **Open issues / next:** Part 3: the review page and the GitHub workflow.

### 2026-10-20: P2 Phase 2, part 1: agendas are saved to Supabase
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, building P2's Phase 2 at the owner's request (Iarush asked for help)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **The robots.txt problem.** It wasn't specific to Gemini: our own bot downloads every page, and the model only reads what we pass it. The `*` group blocks every bot on City Council's PrimeGov site and on Lone Star's PDFs. Owner decision D37 (in `.plans/scraper-progress.md`): keep fetching these government records politely. News still follows D36.
  - **New ingest pipeline** (spec P2-B): `lib/ingest/run.ts`, with the store in `store.ts`, `supabaseStore.ts` and `memoryStore.ts` (tests). It upserts meetings and items, classifies with P3's `classify()`, sets review status, marks removed items, moves upcoming → awaiting_result, applies outcomes and stores documents. A second identical run writes nothing.
  - **Seeding:** `lib/ingest/bodies.ts` and `seed.ts` insert 10 body rows (insert-only) and mirror `data/sources.yaml` into `sources`.
  - **CLI:** `npm run ingest`.
  - **Adapter list:** `ADAPTERS` moved from `scripts/scrape.ts` to `lib/ingest/adapters.ts`.
  - **Adapters:** `llmExtract.ts` and `primegov.ts` accept `max_llm_docs`.
  - **Live backfill:** 646 items across 6 sources; per-source counts are in the progress log.
  - **Fixes to other parts' readers, which capped or dropped rows once real data arrived** (new `lib/paging.ts`):
    - P3's `loadItems` (`lib/weekly/data.ts`) took 500 unordered rows, so City Council and HISD vanished behind 493 Commissioners Court items. It now pages through all rows.
    - P3's `loadPerspectives` now asks for IDs in batches.
    - P4's `loadRegistrationWindows` now pages.
- **Files:**
  - `lib/ingest/{run,store,supabaseStore,memoryStore,bodies,seed,adapters}.ts`
  - `lib/paging.ts`, `scripts/ingest.ts`, `scripts/scrape.ts`, `lib/adapters/{llmExtract,primegov}.ts`
  - `lib/weekly/data.ts`, `lib/perspectives/job.ts`, `lib/registration/server.ts`
  - `package.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.plans/scraper-progress.md`
  - tests: `tests/unit/ingest-{run,scheduled,bodies}.test.ts`, `tests/platform/paging.test.ts`, plus new cases in the llmExtract and primegov tests
- **Contract changes:**
  - **For P1:** `bodies` now has rows for `houston_city_council`, `commissioners_court`, `flood_control`, `port_houston`, `hisd_board`, `cfisd_board`, `hcc_board`, `lone_star_board`, `hcmud_489` and `hcad`. They're inserted only when missing and never overwritten, so fill in the other columns freely, but don't rename the IDs.
  - **`sources`:** the table mirrors the YAML, and `sources.last_checked` now means "last rotation run".
  - **`items`:** the meeting columns and `review_status` follow spec P2-B.
- **Checked:**
  - New tests failed first, then passed. Breaking the retry rule on purpose made its test fail.
  - `npm test`: 709 Vitest + 69 P4 pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - Live, against Supabase: each source run twice, and the second run wrote nothing. SQL found 0 duplicate items or meetings and no names in redacted titles.
  - On production, the lookup for 901 Bagby St returned real bodies. `/api/weekly` showed no upcoming items because of the 500-row cap. Run locally with the fix, it gives a City Council lead story plus 6 coming up.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Part 2: the `/api/cron/ingest` route and scheduler. Part 3: the review page, the GitHub workflow and the D37 pitch line.
  - **P3:** the story job takes the oldest meeting first, 10 per run, and every flagged item gets a story, so 493 past Commissioners Court items sit in front of upcoming ones. Consider putting upcoming meetings first.
  - BoardBook pages hash differently on every fetch, so each run stores 2 new document rows.
  - `gemini-4-argon` returns 404 on Vertex (fine once the OpenRouter key is set). The backfill used `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` as the fallback.
  - **Iarush:** pull before editing `lib/adapters/llmExtract.ts`, `lib/adapters/primegov.ts`, `scripts/scrape.ts` or `lib/ingest/`.
### 2026-10-20: Prepare P1 lookup implementation for P5 setup
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Prepared the P1 lookup and results implementation, source-backed jurisdiction loaders, route-level tests, and body, quiz, and tax-receipt flows for handoff to P5. P5 Supabase credentials, migration application, and source-data loading are still needed to continue live verification.
- **Files:** P1 lookup routes, contracts, data loaders, migration, results/body/quiz/tax-receipt UI and tests; `agent_handoff.md`.
- **Contract changes:** See the P1 implementation entry below; P5 must apply the migration and regenerate database types.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (701 Vitest + 69 P4 tests), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `git diff --check` passed. Live Supabase lookup is unverified because no local credentials are configured.
- **Open issues / next:** P5 to provide Supabase credentials, apply the P1 migration, and coordinate source data loading; then run live lookup and browser checks.

### 2026-10-20: Close P1 lookup test and data-loader blockers
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added route-level `/api/lookup` tests, HCAD real-property TSV-to-sanitized staging, dry-run/apply HCAD and City/School/College boundary loaders, a source-backed map for nine HCAD codes, and source-loading instructions. Lookup now fails closed for unmapped HCAD codes or missing catalog bodies; boundary replacement is atomic per full mapped layer and validates the manifest/vintage/source URL.
- **Files:** `app/api/lookup/route.ts`, `lib/lookup/{hcadSource,hcadStaging,boundaryStaging}.ts`, `scripts/{stage-hcad,load-hcad,load-boundaries,seed-hcad-jurisdictions}.ts`, `data/{hcad-jurisdiction-map,boundary-sources}.yaml`, P1 migration, `docs/p1-data-loading.md`, route and staging tests, `package.json`.
- **Contract changes:** P1 migration adds `load_hcad_batch` and atomic `replace_hcad_boundary_layer` RPCs. P5 must apply it and regenerate `database.types.ts`; permissions remain service-role-only.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (701 Vitest + 69 P4 tests), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, jurisdiction/body seed checks, and `git diff --check` passed. Synthetic HCAD TSV+GeoJSON successfully ran through staging and HCAD loader dry run; fixture stayed under ignored scratch. Local HTTP smoke checks returned 200 for `/`, `/start`, `/results`, and `/app/districts`. No real HCAD data or live lookup was run.
- **Open issues / next:** `.env.local` and Supabase credentials are absent, so migration, seeds, live lookup, and PostGIS loader RPCs remain unapplied/unverified. P1 still needs the two demo ZIPs/addresses and must verify all their codes; only nine HCAD codes are mapped. HCAD City/School/College layers do not cover Houston council districts, ESD/METRO/precinct, or regional water bodies. The plan's generic “other taxing unit” mapping conflicts with safe fail-closed code handling and needs a team choice. Visual browser testing still needs an approved Chrome session.

### 2026-10-20: Implement P1 lookup, results, quiz, and tax surfaces
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Replaced Census-only lookup with Census/HCAD/GIS merge logic, including countywide HCAD, signed body-ID access, HOA candidate review states, quiz scoring/write route, sourced tax receipt and body detail pages. Updated assigned prototype district/vote screens and added a dry-run-first canonical body catalog seed.
- **Files:** `app/api/lookup`, `app/api/quiz`, `app/api/tax-receipt`, `app/api/bodies`, public results/body/receipt pages, `lib/lookup`, `lib/quiz.ts`, `lib/taxReceipt.ts`, `data/bodies.yaml`, `scripts/seed-bodies.ts`, P1 support migration, EN/ES messages and tests.
- **Contract changes:** Added `tax_rates.last_vote_date` and service-role-only HCAD, boundary, and HOA lookup RPCs. P5 must apply the migration and regenerate `database.types.ts`.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (676 Vitest + 69 P4 tests), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run seed:bodies -- --check` passed. `npm run build` is blocked because Google Fonts requests fail in this environment.
- **Open issues / next:** No live Supabase env or migration run; canonical seed was not applied. HCAD/boundary loaders, verified jurisdiction map, address selection, GIS coverage, demo cache/data, and live/PostgREST/browser checks remain. Do not claim end-to-end acceptance until sourced data is loaded and both demo addresses are verified.

### 2026-10-20: Review P1 baseline against implementation plans
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Reviewed current P1 code against the product/technical plans and `tmp/scratch/ishaan_implementation_plan.md`; application code and plan files unchanged. Current lookup remains Census-only; HCAD/GIS resolution, quiz submission/scoring, HOA, tax receipt and public body APIs/pages are pending.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Static inspection of lookup, contracts, tokens, demo helpers, core migration, prototype data bridge and Districts/Vote screens. Targeted Vitest command did not run: no root `node_modules` or local Vitest; stopped the pending `npx` invocation without test output. No live data or browser verification.
- **Open issues / next:** Missing live tax/turnout fields currently produce false “No separate tax”/appointed-board claims. Vote filters prototype `-mud-` IDs, excluding canonical `hcmud_489`, then claims no measures. Lookup does not use demo cache. Coordinate `last_vote_date`, spatial/HOA query support and the missing P2 news read route; await the other session's implementation details for focused review. Demo addresses and 20-address evidence remain unverified in this review.

### 2026-10-20: Add ignored P1 implementation plan
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main (`1e46631`)
- **What changed:** Added the decision-ready P1 implementation plan in the existing ignored scratch area. It clarifies P1/P5 database responsibilities, data flow, demo-first sequence, the editable $250K reference value, and acceptance checks.
- **Files:** `tmp/scratch/ishaan_implementation_plan.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None; planning document only.
- **Checked:** `tmp/` ignore rule and current P1 routes/contracts inspected; documentation only.
- **Open issues / next:** Q10 adult account owner remains pending and does not block P1. The demo addresses still need to be selected and verified during implementation.

### 2026-10-20: Stress test answers: Marie Gary Blueberry (P1)
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main (`1e46631`)
- **What changed:** Recorded the teammate's plan stress-test answers. Q1 P1; Q2–Q9 yes; Q10 adult account owner still pending; Q11–Q16 yes (P2 spec and manual-entry fallback as stated); Q17 dropped because its Monday date passed; Q18 yes; Q19 yes to Twilio API with labeled preview fallback; Q20 yes to Wed evening survey only after live lookup, aim 15/minimum 10 by Thu noon; Q21 willing to register for Oct 27 City Council, not speak.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Compared against the answers received in chat and `plan_stress_test.md`; docs only.
- **Open issues / next:** Q10 remains pending and does not block P1. Survey waits for real Census + HCAD lookup. City Council evidence should say "registered," not "spoke."

### 2026-10-20: Pull latest main and remove local review note
- **Who:** Marie Gary Blueberry · P1 Lookup and Results
- **Branch:** main (`1e46631`)
- **What changed:** Removed the earlier local P1 review entry at the teammate's request, then fast-forwarded from `origin/main`. The pulled update routes shared AI calls through OpenRouter when configured and retains direct Gemini fallback.
- **Files:** upstream changes to `.env.example`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md`, `agent_handoff.md`, shared AI adapters/routes, messages, and tests.
- **Contract changes:** Provider configuration adds `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; Gemini model environment variables stay in use.
- **Checked:** `git pull --ff-only origin main` succeeded, updating `7ca1b60` to `1e46631`; branch matched `origin/main` immediately after pull.
- **Open issues / next:** The worktree now contains only this required handoff note. Refresh the P1 plan against the updated code and plan; OpenRouter availability depends on configuration.

### 2026-10-20: Tech plan now names OpenRouter as the AI provider
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** At PlaidMod's request, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` now says AI calls use Google's Gemini models through OpenRouter. The revision line lists the sections changed. This closes the "Tech plan §1" open item in the entry below.
  - **§1:** names the provider and the default models (`gemini-3.8-flash`, and `gemini-4-argon` for D17), and says to use paid models and check OpenRouter's data-use settings.
  - **§14:** the privacy line says drafts go to OpenRouter, then Google.
  - **§19:** paid models only; OpenRouter, Google and Twilio are named as processors.
  - **§21:** the env var list has `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is marked temporary.
  - **§22:** the model, pricing and budget checks name OpenRouter.
- **Files:** `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed.
- **Open issues / next:** None from this change.

### 2026-10-20: OpenRouter confirmed as the AI provider; coach IP limit and privacy page fixed
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **OpenRouter:** PlaidMod confirmed it for every AI call, which replaces tech plan §1's Gemini direct and answers Iarush's entry below. Gemini direct stays only until `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set.
  - **Fallback model:** P2's default `gemini-pro-latest` isn't on OpenRouter. It's now `gemini-4-argon`, Google's flagship, which is on OpenRouter's model list (checked Oct 20) with structured output and PDF input; the Google SDK takes the same name.
  - **Coach IP limit:** with no trusted header, every visitor on Vercel shared one IP budget, so the whole site got 20 coach calls an hour. `COACH_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER=x-real-ip` is now set in Vercel production and preview, and the handler trims the value.
  - **Privacy page:** names the cookies actually set (`showup_coach_id`, `showup_bodies`, `showup_sub`; `showup_bid` was never set), Photon/OpenStreetMap street suggestions, and OpenRouter. Its date is now Oct 20; the terms page keeps Oct 19.
- **Files:** `lib/adapters/gemini.ts`, `lib/coach/http.ts`, `app/api/coach/route.ts`, `lib/env.ts`, `.env.example`, `messages/{en,es}.json`, `components/legal/LegalDocument.tsx`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tests/platform/openrouter.test.ts`, `tests/coach/integration.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:**
  - None to the schema or types.
  - `Legal.effective` is now `Legal.privacy.effective` and `Legal.terms.effective`.
  - New env var `COACH_TRUSTED_IP_HEADER` (P4).
  - Older entries that call OpenRouter optional, or Gemini the provider, are out of date.
- **Checked:**
  - The 2 new tests failed first, then passed.
  - `npm test`: 650 Vitest + 69 P4 tests pass. Typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - The built `/privacy` (en, es) and `/terms` pages show the new text and dates.
  - `google/gemini-3.8-flash` and Vercel's judge model `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` are on OpenRouter with structured output.
  - No live OpenRouter call was made (no key yet).
- **Open issues / next:**
  - When the key arrives: add it to `.env.local` and Vercel, remove `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, and make one live call.
  - P3: the news spec wants a Pro judge. 3.5 Flash Lite was picked because Pro wasn't usable on Vertex, and `gemini-4-argon` is available now.
  - Tech plan §1 still says Gemini direct.
  - `BROWSER_ID_COOKIE`/`readBrowserId` in `lib/rateLimit.ts` are unused, because P4 uses its own cookie.

### 2026-10-20: Route LLM calls through OpenRouter when its key is set
- **Who:** Iarush
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added an OpenRouter transport (`lib/openrouter.ts`). When `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set, every LLM call (shared `generateJson` for stories/coach/perspectives, and P2's `geminiFromEnv()` for extraction, minutes and news linking) goes to OpenRouter; otherwise Gemini is used as before. Routes now gate on `llmConfigured()` (either key). Model IDs still come from `GEMINI_*_MODEL`; bare IDs get a `google/` prefix.
- **Files:** `lib/openrouter.ts`, `lib/gemini.ts`, `lib/adapters/gemini.ts`, `lib/env.ts`, coach/cron routes, `llm_unavailable` warning text in P2 adapters + tests, `.env.example`, `tests/platform/openrouter.test.ts`.
- **Contract changes:** None to schema/types. New env var `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Deviates from tech plan §1 (Gemini direct): the team should confirm. `llm_unavailable` warning text changed (P2).
- **Checked:** `npm test` 648 Vitest (incl. 5 new OpenRouter tests) + 69 P4 pass; ESLint clean. `tsc --noEmit` errors only in pre-existing `scraper P2/tmp/` scripts, none in changed files. No live OpenRouter call made.
- **Open issues / next:** Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and Vercel. `gemini-pro-latest` (P2 fallback default) is likely not an OpenRouter ID; set `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL` to a real one. `lib/coach/gemini.ts` (test-only) unchanged.

### 2026-10-20: Validate configured P4 and prepare publication
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 Speak up
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Validated the newly supplied local configuration without exposing values. Restored the tracked environment template after it was renamed. Final review fixed Council weekday applicability before offering methods, explicit channel changes now clear prior confirmation, and normal picker defaults exclude past/outcome-pending meetings. Kept explicit historical links available.
- **Files:** P4 modules/screens/tests, root message and data bridges, `docs/p4-status.md`; original merge details below.
- **Contract changes:** No additional shared contracts beyond the prior merge entry.
- **Checked:** 643 Vitest + 69 P4 tests (712 total), lint, typecheck and production build pass. New regressions failed before fixes and pass afterward; independent re-review found no remaining issues in the fixes. Built browser confirms Tuesday Council methods remain available and Wednesday voting items show unknown registration guidance. Configured Gemini structured output and EN/ES coaching pass, including HTTP 200/no-store through the built API. Supabase tables and atomic counter RPC pass; reminders without verified subscription return 401.
- **Open issues / next:** Civic data tables are empty; populate them through the ingestion workflow before claiming real agenda coverage. Twilio is unset; no SMS, registration or public comment was sent. Full provider golden/load testing and MUD rule verification remain open. Local environment values stay ignored. Commit/push authorized by the teammate after checks; recovery stash retained.

### 2026-10-20: Merge upstream platform, scraper and news with P4
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 Speak up
- **Branch:** main, pulled through `748dd41`
- **What changed:** Preserved local work in a recovery stash, fast-forwarded upstream and resolved CLAUDE/handoff conflicts while retaining both histories. Migrated P4 to the root app, restored `web/` to the upstream reference, and connected shared SDK/model configuration, database rate counters, root locales/logos/body IDs, live item loading, P3 deep links, reminder requests and known bounds for the alerts cron. Unknown/special meetings stay conservative; late texts no longer promise unverified written alternatives.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/speak`, `/speak-up/[itemId]`, `/api/coach`, `components/speak`, `lib/{coach,registration,speak}`, P3 data/screen bridges, root messages/tests/docs/tooling.
- **Contract changes:** `Update` gains optional `meetingType` and `agendaNumber`; `comment.minutes` is nullable for unverified allocations. Dashboard/brief/story consumers handle unknown limits. No DB schema, bodies_token, classify or Meeting/Item changes.
- **Checked:** 642 Vitest + 67 P4 tests (709 total), ESLint, typecheck and production build pass. An initial isolation-test timeout passed on rerun. Built app browser: four-step demo, Spanish toggle, draft reload persistence, no overflow at 390px, correct P3-item redirect. Built API returns 400 for malformed input and 403 cross-origin. No unresolved conflicts or whitespace errors.
- **Open issues / next:** Add environment values at the root and restart. Live Gemini, real database quotas/reminders/SMS and real public-comment evidence remain unverified. MUD rules still need confirmation. Dependency install reported 9 high advisories in upstream dependencies; no unrequested dependency updates made. Recovery stash retained. Environment files untouched and ignored; nothing committed or pushed.

### 2026-10-20: P4 verification and documentation audit
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 Speak up
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Re-read repository instructions, handoffs, product/technical plans and P4 modules against acceptance requirements. Fixed corrupt saved browser IDs passing client validation but failing server UUIDv4 validation, with a regression observed failing before and passing after the fix. Corrected stale no-API guidance and documented expired research deadlines and incomplete acceptance criteria.
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `web/README.md`, `.plans/p4-implementation.md`, `web/docs/p4-status.md`, `web/src/lib/speak/client.ts`, `web/tests/speak-client.test.mjs`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Fresh 72/72 tests, ESLint and TypeScript pass. Production build fails fetching Overpass, Libre Franklin and Playfair Display from Google Fonts. Dev server reaches ready; browser navigation times out and direct localhost HTTP is socket-denied.
- **Open issues / next:** Full P4 acceptance remains incomplete: MUD recipe verification, live provider golden evaluation, shared P3/P5 services and actual participation evidence. Subject shortening is deterministic; phone guidance is abbreviated. No live provider or interactive browser success claimed; no commit, push, registration or public comment submitted.

### 2026-10-20: `item_perspectives` table added; prototype-UI rule confirmed
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Applied P3's `item_perspectives` migration to Supabase. Supabase recorded it as version `20261020054945`, so the file is renamed to match. The old file name in the 2026-10-19 P3 entry is out of date.
  - Added the table to `lib/database.types.ts`, from Supabase's generated types. Nothing else in that file changed.
  - **PlaidMod confirmed the Oct 20 rule change:** the prototype UI is the app's UI (see "The prototype UI is now the app's UI" below). Older entries that call `web/` throwaway are out of date.
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/20261020054945_item_perspectives.sql` (renamed), `lib/database.types.ts`
- **Contract changes:** DB schema: new P3 table `item_perspectives`, with RLS on and no policies.
- **Checked:**
  - Supabase: 0 tables without RLS, 0 policies, and the new table is empty.
  - The security advisor shows only the expected "RLS enabled, no policy" notices.
  - `npm test` (636/636, including the migrations RLS checks), typecheck and lint pass.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P3:** `lib/perspectives/job.ts` can use `db()` instead of its untyped client, now that the types include the table.
  - **Deploy:** Vercel blocked sohankamsala's push (`540e161`), because the repo is private, and it can't be redeployed. It goes live with PlaidMod's next push or a CLI deploy by PlaidMod.

### 2026-10-20: P3's app screens follow the plan, in English and Spanish
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** P3's `/app` screens (brief, timeline, alerts and the story sheet) now follow the plan and are translated.
  - **`/app/brief`:** with real data, it uses `buildWeekly()` (plan §10): lead story, "Coming up", "Decided" with "Outcome not posted yet", a "Deadlines this week" sidebar and the template intro line. Decided stories carry the "What news coverage says" block (§9a). The demo keeps its own ordering.
  - **Story sheet:** shows the coverage block, the Spanish story on Spanish pages, the AI label in the page's language, and "Outcome not posted yet".
  - **`/app/timeline`:** the "Decided" tab includes items still waiting on minutes.
  - **`/app/alerts`:** the phone preview now uses the real text code (`itemAlertText`, `reminderText`). The copy matches §11: quiet hours are 8 p.m.–8 a.m. Central with no exception, and STOP stops texts. Before, it said 9 p.m., "unless a vote happens that night" and "we delete your number within 24 hours", none of which the code does.
  - **Time zone:** every date in the `/app` screens (`lib/prototype/format.ts`) is shown in America/Chicago, in the page's language.
  - **Translation (tech plan §17):** P3's screens use new message namespaces `AppBrief`, `AppTimeline`, `AppStory`, `AppAlerts` and `AppLabels`, in en and es.
  - **Text bug fixed:** Spanish texts ended times with "p.m.." (`lib/sms/message.ts`). There's a new regression test.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/app/{brief,timeline,alerts}/`, `components/prototype/{story-sheet,civic}.tsx`, `lib/prototype/{live,liveData,profile,format,types}.ts`, `lib/sms/message.ts`, `messages/*.json`, `tests/prototype/live.test.ts`, `tests/sms/sms.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** The `lib/prototype/types.ts` `Update` type gains `coverage` and `outcomePending`. `LiveData` gains `weekly`. `TierPill` in `components/prototype/civic.tsx` is now translated.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (636), lint and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser, brief, timeline, alerts and the story sheet in en and es, demo and live: no console errors or missing messages.
  - No horizontal scroll at 320–1920px (en) or at 320 and 390px (es).
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P5:** the shell (sidebar, banner, search) and the sheet's "Close" label are still English (§17: P5's).
  - **Demo data:** demo stories stay English, since the plan replaces mock data rather than translating it.
  - **P3's earlier pages:** `/weekly`, `/timeline` and `/alerts` still exist alongside `/app/*`; see the entry above.
  - **Twilio registration:** still not started. It needs an adult account owner.
  - **P4:** `registration_closes_at` stays null until P4's resolver exists, so real items show no sign-up deadlines yet.

### 2026-10-20: Official logos for governments
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The app showed only generic icons, so it looked made up even where the data is real. Each body now shows its official logo or seal wherever it appears: home page stack, `/results`, `/weekly`, `/timeline`, the `/app` sidebar, dashboard, districts, body pages, brief tiles, story sheet, speak and vote.
  - **Bodies with logos:** HISD, Cy-Fair ISD, City of Houston (seal), Harris County, Flood Control, HCC, Lone Star, Harris Health, MUD 489 and CenterPoint. Bodies without one keep their icon tile.
  - **Source:** each file was downloaded once from the body's own website and is served from `public/logos/`, so readers' browsers never contact those sites. `lib/bodyLogos.ts` lists the source of each file.
  - Brief tiles now clamp long headlines so the button always shows; real headlines are longer than the demo ones.
- **Files:** `public/logos/`, `lib/bodyLogos.ts`, `components/civic.tsx` (new `LogoTile`; `BodyIcon` takes an optional `id`), `components/prototype/civic.tsx`, `components/home/GovernmentStack.tsx` (P5's), `app/(prototype)/**`, `app/(public)/{results,weekly,timeline}/page.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** None. `BodyIcon`'s new `id` prop is optional.
- **Checked:** `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass. A browser sweep of 9 pages, in demo and live mode at 320–1920px, found no broken images, console errors or horizontal scroll.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Missing logos:** Port Houston (its site blocks downloads) and HCAD (no usable mark).
  - **Logo use:** logos are shown only to identify the body. If the team would rather not use agency marks, delete the entries in `lib/bodyLogos.ts` and the icons come back.

### 2026-10-20: The prototype UI is now the app's UI (`/app`, `/start`)
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The team decided to use the prototype's finished UI instead of rebuilding it. Its screens were moved from `web/` into the root app as they were, and their demo data is now being replaced with real data screen by screen.
  - **Routes:** `/app` (dashboard), `/app/brief`, `/app/timeline`, `/app/districts`, `/app/districts/[id]`, `/app/speak`, `/app/vote`, `/app/alerts` and `/start`, all with the prototype's sidebar shell.
  - **Real data so far:**
    - After an address lookup, `/results` has "Open your dashboard". It goes through `/app/use?t=<bodies_token>`, which keeps the token in an httpOnly `showup_bodies` cookie (body IDs only).
    - With that cookie, every `/app` screen shows the reader's real bodies and P3's real items (`lib/weekly/data.ts`: `classify()` tiers, stories, the AI label and source links).
    - `/app/alerts` uses P3's real Twilio sign-up (`AlertSignup`).
    - Without the cookie, the screens show the demo neighborhood with its "Sample data" label. Without Supabase, they show P3's labeled sample items.
  - **Still demo data:** body descriptions beyond what's known for 7 bodies, `/app/speak`, `/app/vote` and `/start` onboarding.
- **Files:** `app/(prototype)/`, `components/prototype/`, `lib/prototype/` (`live.ts` maps real data onto the screens, `liveData.ts` loads it), `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `tests/prototype/`, and the docs: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md` (top note), `README.md`, plus the contract list at the top of this file.
- **Contract changes:**
  - **Docs:** `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` used to say `web/` was throwaway. They now say its UI is the app's UI and its sample data gets replaced. Earlier entries that call `web/` throwaway are out of date.
  - **New cookie:** `showup_bodies` holds a `bodies_token`.
  - The `lib/prototype/types.ts` `Update` type gains `aiWritten` and `itemPath`.
- **PlaidMod, please confirm:** this reverses the old "don't build on `web/`" rule. Tech plan §17 already assigns each part its prototype screens to convert (P1: districts and vote; P3: timeline, brief and alerts; P4: speak; P5: home, onboarding and shell). Change it back if you disagree.
- **Checked:** `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass. In the browser, I went from the address box through the stake picker and results to the dashboard, then opened every `/app` screen and a story. There were no console errors and no horizontal scroll at 1366px or 390px.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Everyone:** the screen text is still English in code. Move it into `messages/*.json` per tech plan §17.
  - **P1:** body pages need real descriptions; `toBody()` in `lib/prototype/live.ts` leaves them empty rather than inventing them.
  - **P4:** `/app/speak` builds a comment from a template; check it against the "never ghostwrites" rule before wiring it to real data.
  - **P5:** `/weekly`, `/timeline` and `/alerts` (P3's earlier pages) duplicate `/app/brief`, `/app/timeline` and `/app/alerts`. Decide whether to redirect them; text links still go to `/items/[id]`, which stays.
  - The dev palette picker wasn't carried over.

### 2026-10-19: Address suggestions and a stand-in /api/lookup
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts (filling a P1 gap)
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** The home address box failed for every address because P1's `/api/lookup` doesn't exist yet.
  - **Dropdown:** the box now suggests streets as you type (ARIA combobox: arrow keys, Enter, Escape). Suggestions come from Photon (OpenStreetMap), limited to Harris County. Only the street words are sent; the house number stays in the browser.
  - **Stand-in lookup:** `POST /api/lookup` follows `lib/contracts/lookup.ts`. It geocodes with the Census Geocoder and returns the bodies it can infer: city council, county, flood control, port, school board, college board and HCAD. It can't find MUDs, ESDs, METRO or HOAs. It returns `outside_harris` for other counties.
  - **Temporary `/results`:** lists the bodies with links to `/weekly?t=` and `/alerts?t=`.
  - Nothing about the address is stored or logged.
- **Files:** `components/home/AddressForm.tsx`, `lib/lookup/` (`suggest.ts`, `census.ts`, `standIn.ts`), `app/api/address/suggest/route.ts`, `app/api/lookup/route.ts`, `app/(public)/results/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`Home.suggestions*`, `Home.addNumber`, `Results`), `tests/lookup/`
- **Contract changes:** None. The route matches P1's draft contract. **P1:** replace the body of `app/api/lookup/route.ts` and `lib/lookup/standIn.ts` with your lookup; the home page and stake picker won't need changes.
- **Checked:** `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass. In the browser, typing "16915 Apple River" shows the right street, Enter goes to `/stake`, and the lookup returns the Cy-Fair bodies.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Without `BODIES_TOKEN_SECRET`, the lookup returns an `unsigned-preview` token (never in production).
  - Photon is a free public service with no SLA. If it's down, the dropdown stays empty and typing still works.

### 2026-10-19: Wider page layout on large screens
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commit; not pushed)
- **What changed:** On a 1920px screen the site sat in a narrow 1024px column with wide empty margins.
  - The header, footer, home page and every P3 page now use `max-w-7xl` (1280px) with `md:px-8`, and 1440px at `2xl` (≥1536px).
  - At `xl`, the home headline and lede are larger so the hero fills the wider column.
  - Reading pages (`/items/[id]`, `/timeline`, `/alerts/why`) keep a `max-w-3xl` text column, aligned to the same left edge as the header instead of centered, so the tabs line up with the logo.
  - Headlines are smaller below 640px, so a story isn't eight lines of title on a 320px phone.
  - `/alerts` overflowed at 320px because of an unbreakable link in the sample texts; it now wraps.
- **Files:** `components/shell/SiteHeader.tsx`, `components/shell/SiteFooter.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx` (P5's), and P3's pages under `app/(public)/` (`weekly`, `timeline`, `items/[id]`, `alerts`, `alerts/why`), plus `components/weekly/Coverage.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** None. **PlaidMod:** these are your shell and home files; change them back if you'd rather.
- **Checked:** A Playwright sweep of 9 pages at 9 widths (320, 375, 414, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1920 and 2560) found no horizontal scroll and no content past the viewport edge. Screenshots at 320, 768, 1024, 1920 and 2560 were reviewed. `npm test`, lint and typecheck pass.
- **Open issues / next:** None.

### 2026-10-19: P3 pages, APIs, alerts and news coverage perspectives
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (local commits; not pushed)
- **What changed:** Finished P3's user-facing side on top of the core logic:
  - **Pages:** `/weekly` (bento brief; the teammate picked this layout), `/items/[id]`, `/timeline`, `/alerts` (opt-in, published rules, text preview) and `/alerts/why`
  - **API routes:** `/api/weekly`, `/api/items/[id]`, `/api/alerts/subscribe` and `/verify`, `/api/reminders`, `/api/twilio/inbound`, `/api/cron/alerts` and `/api/cron/stories`
  - **Story job:** writes stories for items with `needs_story = true`
  - **Perspectives (§9a):** extract, code checks, judge, freeze, removal, the `item_perspectives` migration and the "What news coverage says" block
  - **Messages:** `News`, `Weekly`, `Timeline`, `Item`, `Alerts` and `Coverage` keys in `messages/en.json` and `es.json`
- **Sample data:** without the Supabase keys, the pages show labeled sample data (`lib/weekly/sample.ts`) run through the real `classify()` and template stories. Sample coverage uses placeholder outlets, never real ones.
- **Contract changes:**
  - **New migration:** `supabase/migrations/20261019230000_item_perspectives.sql` (P3 table). P5 applies it and regenerates `lib/database.types.ts`. Until then, perspectives code uses an untyped client.
  - **New cookie:** `showup_sub`, a signed `users.id` (HMAC with `BODIES_TOKEN_SECRET`), set after phone verification. **P4:** call `POST /api/reminders {item_id}`; it returns 401 `not_subscribed` without the cookie.
  - **ESLint:** `lib/rules`, `lib/stories` and `lib/sms` can't import `lib/news` or `lib/perspectives` (perspectives spec §8).
  - **Cron:** `/api/cron/alerts` now runs the story job and the perspectives job before alerts. `vercel.json` is unchanged.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` 611/611, `npm run lint` and typecheck pass.
  - In the browser, at 1366px and 390px (no horizontal scroll), all five pages render in English and Spanish with no console errors or missing message keys.
  - Alerts sign-up errors and the preview state were tested in the browser.
  - No live Supabase, Gemini or Twilio calls were made, because there are no keys on this machine.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P5:** apply the `item_perspectives` migration.
  - **P5:** the cron needs `SITE_URL` set so text links and the Twilio signature URL are right.
  - **P5:** `GEMINI_JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-lite` (already on Vercel) is P3's choice: a different model from the 3.8 Flash extractor, as the spec asks, and Pro isn't usable on Vertex.
  - **P4:** `registration_closes_at` is null for real items until P4's registration resolver exists. The weekly page, texts and 7a/7b reminders read it from `lib/weekly/data.ts` and the `windows` argument of `runAlertsJob`.
  - **P2:** the perspectives job reads `news_article_items` and `news_articles` (spec §5). Until those tables are migrated, it logs a warning and the weekly page shows "No news coverage found."
  - **P1:** pages need `?t=<bodies_token>` from the results page. There's no `/api/lookup` yet, which is why the home address box currently says "We couldn't find that address" for every address.
  - **Twilio:** still not registered (needs an adult account owner). Without keys, sign-up shows a labeled preview and nothing is sent or saved.
  - **Spec deviation:** bento tiles are whole-card links, so they show only "N news outlets"; the full coverage disclosure appears on the rest of "Coming up," on "Decided," and on item pages.
  - **Stress test:** still deferred for sohankamsala.

### 2026-10-19: P3 core logic: rule engine, stories, SMS, weekly builder
- **Who:** sohankamsala · P3 Weekly News and Alerts
- **Branch:** main (uncommitted)
- **What changed:** Built P3's server logic as tested library code in P5's root app (tech plan §2). Covered:
  - `classify()` with all six rules (§8)
  - story writing with code fact-check and template fallback, using P5's `lib/gemini.ts` (§9)
  - SMS logic: consent, quiet hours, message format with the late-added wording, reminders 7a/7b, protest reminder, send dedupe, Twilio REST client, STOP/HELP keywords and webhook signature check (§11)
  - the weekly page and timeline section builder (§10)
  - Twilio registration paperwork, ready to paste
- **Files:** `lib/rules/`, `lib/stories/`, `lib/sms/`, `lib/weekly/`, `tests/{rules,stories,sms,weekly}/`, `.plans/p3-twilio-registration.md`
- **Contract changes:**
  - **`classify` is the real `Classifier` for ingest:** P2 can swap `classifyStub` for `classify` from `lib/rules/classify.ts`. A test checks it's assignable to `Classifier` and accepts P2's `Item`. An optional 4th argument, `{date, previous_date}`, drives `meeting_moved`. It reads `no_new_revenue_rate` from the untyped `taxRates`.
  - Personnel and closed-session items always return `tier: 'timeline'` and `item_type: 'personnel'`, never `sms` (scraper spec §5.3).
  - **The story job must write stories for every `needs_story` item, whatever its tier,** so personnel items still get one (D9).
  - Uses the shared `BodyType` (`lib/contracts/bodyTypes.ts`) and `Stake` (`lib/stakes.ts`) for lead-story ordering.
- **Checked:** `npm test` passes (46 files, 586 tests, including 83 new P3 tests). `npm run typecheck` is clean, and `eslint` is clean on the P3 folders. No live Gemini or Twilio calls were made; both are tested with fakes.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Next for P3:** wire these into routes and screens:
    - routes: `api/weekly`, `api/items`, `api/alerts/subscribe` and `verify`, `api/reminders`, `api/twilio/inbound`, `api/cron/alerts`
    - the story job that writes stories for `needs_story` items
    - pages: `/weekly`, `/timeline`, `/items/[id]` and `/alerts` (opt-in, rules, why-this-text)
    - en/es message keys for all of the above
  - **P2:** ingest can import `classify` now. Pass the meeting's `{date, previous_date}` as the 4th argument so `meeting_moved` works.
  - **P5 / schema:** the HCAD protest reminder has no item, so it's queued with `item_id = null`. Because `alerts_sent` treats nulls as equal, a user gets at most one protest reminder ever, not one per year. That's fine for the hackathon; a `year` column would fix it later.
  - **P5:** reminder 7b needs the alerts job to run more than once a day. Vercel Hobby cron is daily, so trigger `/api/cron/alerts` from the GitHub Actions schedule too.
  - **Twilio registration not submitted.** It needs an adult account owner plus the SMS wording in `.plans/p3-twilio-registration.md` §4 on P5's live privacy and terms pages. If it isn't approved by Thursday, fall back to a labeled "preview" of texts.
  - **Stress test:** deferred for sohankamsala, who asked to start P3 work first. Run it at the next session.

### 2026-10-19: Trimmed crowding on the prototype's Districts and Vote screens
- **Who:** sohankamsala · prototype owner (part not yet confirmed)
- **Branch:** main (uncommitted)
- **What changed:** In the `web/` prototype, removed the description column from the Districts list and folded Vote's two info cards ("Bring a photo ID", "Register at school") into one line. This finishes the declutter pass whose home and timeline trims are already in `main`.
- **Files:** `web/src/app/app/districts/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/app/vote/page.tsx`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` pass. Checked both screens at 1440px in a local browser; 390px not checked.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Attribution leak:** commit `cfa43fe` ("Add ShowUp HTX web app prototype and design system") is on `origin/main` with a `Co-Authored-By` AI trailer. It was made before `INSTRUCTIONS.md` existed. Fixing it means rewriting published history, so it needs a team decision.
  - On Vote, the eligibility timeline's "Today" and "Can register" labels overlap when registration opens the next day.
  - The plan stress test hasn't been run for sohankamsala yet.

### 2026-10-19: Admin accounts, and a script for admins to set their own password
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **The team's five emails** are now in `ADMIN_EMAILS`, in the owner's `.env.local` and on Vercel.
  - **Each has a confirmed Supabase account** with a temporary shared password, set by the owner. Ask PlaidMod for it; it isn't written anywhere in the repo.
  - **Each admin can change their password** with `npm run admin -- set-password <email>`. The password is typed twice and never shown, and must be 12–72 characters.
  - **No email step:** Supabase's built-in email can't send setup links to people outside the Supabase organization, so the script uses the secret key from `.env.local` instead.
  - **`npm run admin -- create-all`** creates any missing accounts after someone is added to `ADMIN_EMAILS`.
- **Files:** `lib/adminAccounts.ts`, `scripts/admin-account.ts`, `tests/platform/adminAccounts.test.ts`, `package.json` (`admin` script), `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` 503/503, typecheck and lint pass.
  - Against the real project, a throwaway account was created, given a password, signed in, rejected a wrong password, then deleted.
  - `set-password` refuses an email not on the list, and refuses to run where the password would show on screen.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Everyone changes the shared password** with `set-password` before the repo goes public. The login page is public, and admin emails show up in commit history.
  - The owner turns off public sign-ups in Supabase (**Authentication → Sign In / Providers**).
  - **P3 chooses `GEMINI_JUDGE_MODEL`.** Vercel has `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, which works on Vertex; ask P5 to change it.

### 2026-10-19: Supabase secret key and Gemini settings added to Vercel
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main (no code changes)
- **What changed:** Vercel Production and Preview now have:
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` (a Vertex AI key), both Sensitive, so their values can't be read back from Vercel
  - `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`, `GEMINI_EXTRACT_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash` and `GEMINI_JUDGE_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-lite`

  The owner's `.env.local` has the same values.
- **Files:** this log only
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:**
  - The Supabase key returned HTTP 200 from the REST API.
  - `npx tsx scripts/gemini-smoke.ts` returned `{ ok: true }` on Vertex AI for `gemini-3.8-flash` and `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`.
  - **`gemini-pro-latest` returns 404 NOT_FOUND on Vertex,** so P2's default fallback model fails there.
  - `vercel env ls` lists all five variables for both environments.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P2:** set `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL` to a Pro model ID that Vertex lists, check it with `npx tsx scripts/gemini-smoke.ts --model <id>`, then ask P5 to add it to Vercel.
  - No live page uses the database or Gemini yet, so nothing was redeployed. The next deploy picks these up.
  - Teammates who need the keys locally get them from P5 privately. Because they're Sensitive, `vercel env pull` leaves them out.

### 2026-10-19: P2's scraper merged into `main` and moved into the root app
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main (merged `scrapper` at `c6a6990`)
- **What changed:**
  - **The merge** keeps both sides of this log and the branch's newer revision 5 of both plan files. The one line kept from `main` is the body-page "In the news" bullet.
  - **The code moved, unchanged,** from `scraper P2/` into the layout in scraper spec §6: `lib/adapters/`, `lib/ingest/`, `lib/news/`, `data/`, `scripts/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/golden/` and `vitest.live.config.ts`.
  - **P2's dependencies and scripts** (`test:live`, `scrape`, `news`) are now in the root `package.json`, and the lockfile was regenerated. The root keeps ESLint 9 and TypeScript 5.9, which Next 16.4.2 needs; the branch used 10 and 6.
  - **Root configs:** ESLint now uses P2's full news-isolation patterns and P2's `^_` unused-variable rule. Vitest excludes `tests/live/`. `GEMINI_JUDGE_MODEL` is added to `.env.example` and `lib/env.ts`.
- **Two fixes to P2's files:**
  - **`tests/unit/news-article.test.ts`:** the fake-timer Crawl-delay test now calls `resetHostSpacing()` first. Leftover real-clock spacing made it pass only when run before Oct 19 12:00 UTC.
  - **`lib/adapters/gemini.ts`:** the `*FromEnv` functions now take a plain string map, because Next's `ProcessEnv` type requires `NODE_ENV`. This is a type change only.
- **Files:** P2's folders above, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.env.example`, `lib/env.ts`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes (P2):**
  - Work on `main` from the repo root from now on. The scripts read the root `.env.local`.
  - Phase 2 can import `@/lib/db`. P1's `bodies` seed is the only Phase 2 prerequisite still missing.
  - The v1.3 tables (`news_articles`, `news_article_items`, the 11c and `health()` state) still need migrations: P2 writes them, P5 applies them.
- **Checked:** `npm test` 492/492 (P5's 128, P2's 364; UTC, network blocked), typecheck, lint (0 warnings) and build. `npm run scrape -- --source no_such_source` loads `data/sources.yaml` and makes no network calls.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - No live runs yet (no Gemini key).
  - `gemini-pro-latest` won't work on Vertex (see the Vertex entry below).

### 2026-10-19: Gemini can run on Vertex AI; `.env.local` laid out for every key
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Vertex AI needs no change to either Gemini client.**
    - `lib/gemini.ts` and P2's `lib/adapters/gemini.ts` both call `new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey })`.
    - With `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`, `@google/genai` 2.30.0 sends the same call to Vertex AI (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`), using the key. Without it, the call goes to the Gemini API.
  - **`.env.example`:** adds `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`, plus where to get the Gemini, Supabase secret and Twilio keys.
  - **`scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`:** a new `--model <id>` option checks that a model ID works, and the output names the backend it used.
  - **The owner's `.env.local`** now follows the template. Every existing value is kept, and the blank lines are the keys still to fill in.
- **Files:** `.env.example`, `scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`
- **Contract changes (P2, P3, P4):**
  - **The team's Gemini key will be a Vertex AI key.** Wherever `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, also set `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`. That includes `scraper P2/.env.local`, because P2's scripts load that file. If the switch is missing, the Vertex key goes to the Gemini API and the call fails.
  - **P2: `gemini-pro-latest` is a Gemini API alias.**
    - Vertex's model list (Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform > Model versions) has no `-latest` aliases.
    - Its only long-lived Pro text model, `gemini-2.5-pro`, retires Oct 20, 2026.
    - Pick the extraction fallback (and P3's judge model) from that list, then check it with `npx tsx scripts/gemini-smoke.ts --model <id>`.
    - `gemini-3.8-flash` is GA on Vertex.
  - **FYI:** Google's 3.8 Flash guide says the backend ignores `temperature` for this model; determinism comes from `thinking_level` and the response schema. Both clients send `temperature: 0`, which is harmless.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (128/128), typecheck and lint pass.
  - A probe with a fake `fetch` (no network) confirmed both endpoints: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` when the switch is unset, and `aiplatform.googleapis.com` when it's `true`. Both send the key in the `x-goog-api-key` header.
  - Without a key, the smoke script stops with `MissingEnvError`.
  - No live call yet, because there's no key.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - The owner adds the Vertex key and runs the smoke test.
  - The owner shares the key privately with P2 for `scraper P2/.env.local`.
  - The Gemini key and the switch need adding to Vercel, after the owner approves.
  - **Free keys may lack 3.8 Flash:** Google's express-mode page (the free 90-day trial) doesn't list `gemini-3.8-flash`, so a key without billing may not reach it.

### 2026-10-19: P5 final review fixes (rate limits, demo cache, admin cookies, privacy page)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** A fresh whole-branch review of P5 found no critical issues. These five are fixed:
  - **Rate limiter:**
    - `checkRateLimit` now throws `MissingEnvError` when a key is missing, instead of quietly allowing every call.
    - On a database error it still allows the call, and now logs a warning. The warning never includes the key.
  - **Demo cache:**
    - `lookupDemoKey` is now an HMAC keyed with `IP_HASH_SECRET`, so a cache key can't be matched against `hcad_parcels` addresses.
    - `DEMO_RECORD` is ignored on production deployments (`VERCEL_ENV=production`).
  - **Admin session cookies** are now `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, and `Secure` in production (`lib/supabase/cookieOptions.ts`).
  - **Privacy page:** it now says the address goes to the U.S. Census Bureau's address lookup, and lists the Census Bureau among the services that process data.
  - **`lib/database.types.ts`:** I regenerated it from the database. It matches the committed file exactly, so it needed no change.
- **Files:** `lib/rateLimit.ts`, `lib/demo.ts`, `lib/env.ts` (`VERCEL_ENV`), `lib/supabase/{cookieOptions,server}.ts`, `proxy.ts`, `messages/*.json`, `.env.example`, `tests/platform/{rateLimit,demo,authCookies,messages}.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:**
  - **P1, `lookupDemoKey(address, secret?)`:**
    - Pass your own normalized address. Otherwise "Dr" and "Drive" give different keys, and demo mode misses the cache.
    - Cache only the final lookup response (body IDs and sections), never raw Census or HCAD output.
  - **P1 and P4:** `checkRateLimit` now throws when `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing. That key must be on Vercel before your routes ship.
  - **P1:** `/results` must live under `app/(public)/`, because `useLookup()` throws outside that folder. It must also handle the `error` state, not just `idle`: if a lookup fails while someone presses Continue, they can still land on `/results`.
  - **P2:** call `await requireAdmin()` outside any `try/catch`. Its redirect and its 404 work by throwing.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (128/128), typecheck, lint and build pass. Each new test failed before its fix.
  - None of the secrets appear in `.next/static`.
  - The server role can run `increment_rate_limit`: `has_function_privilege` returns true.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **The new cookie flags can't be checked in a browser yet:** nobody can sign in until the admin accounts exist.
  - **Deferred small items:**
    - `readBrowserId` can throw on a malformed cookie.
    - Old rate-limit rows are cleaned up only on about 1 call in 100.
    - IPv6 addresses aren't grouped by /64.
    - The migration test misses some patterns.
    - The time-zone wiring has no test.
    - **`scripts/quiz-report.ts` reads at most 1,000 rows** and filters them in JavaScript. Fix this before using its numbers in the pitch.
    - The lookup `fetch` has no timeout.
    - The admin sign-in has no rate limit.
    - The `rate_limited` copy is wrong, and the news fonts are preloaded on every page.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 17: classmate quiz report
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `lib/quizReport.ts` turns `quiz_responses` into the plan's evidence lines, for example "14 of 18 (78%) didn't know they had a MUD." `scripts/quiz-report.ts --since <ISO> --until <ISO>` prints them along with "Results from N people who used our app." The time window leaves out the team's own test runs.
- **Files:** `lib/quizReport.ts`, `scripts/quiz-report.ts`, `tests/platform/quizReport.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None. The report reads P1's `quiz_responses` (`selected_types`, `actual_types`, `created_at`) and prints type keys until P1's display names exist.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (121/121, including the plan's 14-of-18 example, rounding, and the window edges), typecheck and lint pass. Running the script needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`.
- **Open issues / next:** All 17 P5 tasks are coded. Next comes a whole-branch review, then the owner's dashboard steps (the secret key, admin accounts, turning off sign-ups) and the non-code checklist in `.plans/p5-platform-plan.md`.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 16: admin sign-in for the review queue
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - `/admin/login` has an email-and-password form. It uses passwords, not email links, because Supabase's built-in email reaches only team members, 2 an hour.
  - `/admin` shows "Signed in as …", a link to `/admin/review` (P2's page) and a sign-out button.
  - `proxy.ts` (Next 16's request hook) refreshes the session on `/admin/*` only. It never touches `/api`, so cron calls can't be redirected.
  - `requireAdmin()` checks the signed-in user with Supabase Auth and the `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist. Signed out goes to the login page; not on the list gets a 404.
- **Files:** `proxy.ts`, `lib/supabase/server.ts`, `lib/adminAuth.ts`, `app/admin/{page.tsx,actions.ts,login/page.tsx}`, `components/admin/LoginForm.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`Admin`), `tests/platform/adminAuth.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (P2):**
  - **Call `await requireAdmin()` first in `/admin/review` and in every one of its server actions and route handlers.** A layout check alone isn't enough.
  - After that, read and write with `db()`. The signed-in user's own Supabase client still sees nothing, because of RLS.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (114/114), typecheck, lint and build pass (the build lists "Proxy").
  - Signed out, `/admin` returns 307 to `/admin/login`.
  - `/api/cron/ingest` with the secret returns 404 (no route yet), not a redirect.
  - A wrong email or password shows the inline error, using the real Supabase sign-in.
  - Login pages send `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **Owner, in the Supabase dashboard:** turn off public sign-ups and create a password account for each `ADMIN_EMAILS` address. After that, a successful sign-in still needs testing.
  - Add the fifth teammate's email to `ADMIN_EMAILS` when known.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 15: demo mode caching
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `lib/demo.ts` has `demoCached(key, compute)`.
  - **With `DEMO_MODE=true`,** it returns the cached answer from `demo_cache` and never calls the outside service. A missing answer throws `DemoCacheMissError`, naming the key, so gaps show up in the dry run instead of silently using the network.
  - **With `DEMO_RECORD=true`,** live answers are saved as you click through the demo once.
  - `lookupDemoKey(address)` is a hash, so not even the demo addresses are stored.
- **Files:** `lib/demo.ts`, `tests/platform/demo.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (how to use it):**
  - **P1 (`/api/lookup`):** wrap the Census/HCAD work in `demoCached(lookupDemoKey(address), () => resolveLive(address))`, and skip writing `quiz_responses` when `isDemoMode()`.
  - **P4 (coach, Step A):** wrap the Gemini explain call in `demoCached(\`explain:${itemId}:${lang}\`, …)`.
  - **Meaning of demo mode:** "no Census, Gemini or Twilio calls." The database stays reachable, so §20's "network off" can't fully hold. **Production keeps `DEMO_MODE=false`,** because judges may open the live site. Record the video locally or on a preview deploy with `DEMO_MODE=true`.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (110/110), typecheck and lint pass.
- **Open issues / next:** Task 16 (admin sign-in) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 14: stake picker
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `/stake` asks "Which of these describe you?"
  - **Cards:** four toggle cards (Student, Parent, Renter, Homeowner; pick any, `aria-pressed`), the note "First-time voters: pick Student." and a language choice.
  - **Continue** saves the choice in the `showup_stakes` cookie, then goes to `/results` while a lookup is running or done, or home when there's no lookup (a reload or a direct visit). **Skip** goes the same way without saving.
  - **Status:** while loading, the page says "Finding your governments…". A failed lookup shows the error with "Try another address."
- **Files:** `lib/stakes.ts`, `app/actions/stakes.ts`, `components/stake/StakePicker.tsx`, `app/(public)/stake/page.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`Stake`), `tests/platform/stakes.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (P1, P3, P4):**
  - Read stakes with `parseStakes(cookieValue)` from `@/lib/stakes`. On the server, use `parseStakes((await cookies()).get(STAKES_COOKIE)?.value)`. It returns `Stake[]` (`'student' | 'parent' | 'renter' | 'homeowner'`) in display order.
  - In the browser the cookie shows URL-encoded (`student%2Crenter`). `parseStakes` handles both forms.
  - No stakes means the visitor skipped, so use defaults.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (104/104), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - In a browser at 390px:
    - a direct visit works and Continue goes home
    - Space and Enter toggle the cards
    - Continue saves the cookie
    - home → address → `/stake` keeps the lookup state and shows the error (expected until P1's route exists)
    - saved stakes come back on return
    - switching to Español keeps the selections
    - nothing scrolls sideways
- **Open issues / next:** Task 15 (demo mode) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 13: home page and the address lookup flow
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Home (`/`):** the headline "Who governs your block?", the address form, a privacy note, and a stack of government "layers" that settles in on load (turned off under reduced motion). The page is in English and Spanish.
  - **Submitting:** the form checks the address on submit (empty or over 200 characters shows an inline error, cleared on edit). It then starts the lookup and goes to `/stake`.
  - **`LookupProvider`** (in `app/(public)/layout.tsx`) keeps the lookup running across home → stake picker → results. The address stays in memory only: never in storage, a cookie or the URL. The form also posts rather than using GET, so a submit before the JavaScript loads can't put the address in a URL.
- **Files:** `lib/contracts/lookup.ts`, `lib/address.ts`, `lib/flow/lookupState.ts`, `components/flow/LookupProvider.tsx`, `components/home/{AddressForm,GovernmentStack}.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `app/(public)/layout.tsx`, `messages/*.json` (`Home`, `Lookup`)
- **Contract changes (draft for P1's sign-off):** `lib/contracts/lookup.ts`.
  - **Request:** `POST /api/lookup` with `{ address }`.
  - **Success:** `{ bodies_token, bodies, ballot, not_government, regional, hoa }`.
  - **Errors:** `{ error: { code, message } }` with codes `invalid_address` 400, `not_found` 404, `outside_harris` 422, `rate_limited` 429, `server_error` 500. The messages for each code are in `messages/*.json` → `Lookup.errors`.
  - **P1's `/results`:** use `useLookup()` from `@/components/flow/LookupProvider`. It returns `state` (`idle | loading | done | error`), `start` and `reset`. While it's loading, show the "Who governs you?" question. If someone opens `/results` directly with `idle`, send them home.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (94/94: address normalizing and limits; the reducer ignores stale answers from a double submit and answers after a reset), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - In a browser at 1440px and 390px:
    - no sideways scrolling
    - an empty submit shows "Enter your street address, city and ZIP." with `aria-invalid`, and typing clears it
    - a real address sends `POST /api/lookup` and goes to `/stake`, with no address in any URL (both 404 for now: P1's route and P5 Task 14)
- **Open issues / next:** Task 14 (the stake picker) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 12: rate limiting and the browser ID
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `lib/rateLimit.ts` and a new database function, `increment_rate_limit` (security invoker, fixed `search_path`, execute revoked from public, anon and authenticated).
  - **`checkRateLimit(key, rule)`** counts one call in a fixed window. It returns `{ allowed, remaining, resetAt }`. If the database can't be reached, it returns `allowed: true, degraded: true` so the demo keeps working.
  - **Presets:** `RATE_LIMITS.lookupPerIp` (120 an hour, so a whole class can share a school IP), `coachPerBrowser` and `coachPerIp` (20 an hour, per §14).
  - **IPs:** `hashIp(ip)` scrambles an IP with `IP_HASH_SECRET` plus the Chicago date, so raw IPs are never stored. `clientIp(req)` reads the visitor's IP.
  - **Browser ID:** `BROWSER_ID_COOKIE = 'showup_bid'`. `readBrowserId(req)` returns null unless the cookie is a UUID; `newBrowserId()` makes one.
  - About 1 call in 100 also deletes windows older than two days, matching the privacy page.
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/20261019112411_rate_limit_fn.sql`, `lib/rateLimit.ts`, `lib/database.types.ts` (function type), `tests/platform/rateLimit.test.ts`, `tests/platform/migrations.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:**
  - **P1 (`/api/lookup`):** `checkRateLimit(\`lookup:ip:${hashIp(clientIp(req))}\`, RATE_LIMITS.lookupPerIp)`. Return 429 `rate_limited` when it's not allowed.
  - **P4 (`/api/coach`):** check both `coach:browser:<id>` and `coach:ip:<hash>`. Set the `showup_bid` cookie (httpOnly, `sameSite=lax`, 1 year) when `readBrowserId` returns null. Note that §14's 20 an hour **per IP** may block a class on shared Wi-Fi. Consider raising `coachPerIp`.
  - **Every new SQL function** must be `security invoker` and revoke execute from public, anon and authenticated. `npm test` checks this.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (83/83; the new function check failed first on a version without the security lines), typecheck and lint pass.
  - In the database: calling the function twice returns 1 then 2; `anon` and `authenticated` can't run it; `get_advisors` shows only the expected notices. The test row was deleted.
- **Open issues / next:** Task 13 (home page and the lookup flow) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 11: site shell and security headers
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Every page under `app/(public)/` now gets the shell:
  - a "Skip to content" link, first in tab order
  - a header with the logo, an About link and the English/Español toggle
  - a footer with "We summarize. We never recommend." and links to About, Privacy and Terms

  The language toggle is a plain form that calls a server action (`switchLocale`), so it works even before the page's JavaScript loads. Next.js re-renders the page in the new language, and the visitor stays on the same page. Every route also sends the four security headers.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/layout.tsx`, `components/shell/{SiteHeader,SiteFooter,LanguageToggle}.tsx`, `app/actions/locale.ts`, `next.config.ts`, `components/civic.tsx` (the logo now reads as "ShowUp HTX"), `messages/*.json` (`Shell` namespace)
- **Contract changes:** None.
  - **For pages in `app/(public)/`:** use a single `<main id="main">` per page; the skip link targets it.
  - **For other screens** (stake picker, Speak up), you can drop in `<LanguageToggle />` from `@/components/shell/LanguageToggle`. It's a server component.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (70/70), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - `curl -sI` shows `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options` and `Permissions-Policy`.
  - In a browser at 390px and 1440px:
    - nothing scrolls sideways (both languages)
    - the first Tab reaches "Skip to content", which floats over the page
    - Español switches the header, footer and page, and sets `<html lang="es">`; the choice survives a reload
    - clicking right after the page loads still works (the first version, a client-side button, ignored early clicks)
- **Open issues / next:** Task 12 (rate limiting) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 10: design system brought into the app
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Brought over from `web/`:** the color tokens (`app/globals.css`), the fonts (Overpass, plus Playfair and Libre Franklin for news), all 25 shadcn components (`components/ui/`), `cn()`, the favicon and `DESIGN.md`. `DESIGN.md` now sits at the root, with a top note marking its prototype-only sections.
  - **Fixed along the way:**
    - corner sizes now match DESIGN.md (`rounded-2xl` is 16px, `rounded-xl` is 12px)
    - inputs are 44px pills with a denim focus ring
    - toasts no longer need next-themes
  - **New shared pieces** in `components/civic.tsx`: `Panel`, `SectionTitle`, `Chip`, `ArrowCircle`, `Logo`, `BodyIcon` and `TierPill`.
  - The palette dev tool stayed behind.
- **Files:** `app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/favicon.ico`, `components/ui/*`, `components/civic.tsx`, `components.json`, `lib/utils.ts`, `lib/contrast.ts`, `lib/contracts/bodyTypes.ts`, `DESIGN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `messages/*.json` (`Civic` namespace), tests
- **Contract changes:** **Draft for P1's sign-off:** `lib/contracts/bodyTypes.ts`. It lists the plan's 12 "Who governs you?" types as `QUIZ_BODY_TYPES`: `city_council`, `commissioners_court`, `school_board`, `college_board`, `mud`, `esd`, `water_authority`, `flood_control`, `port`, `metro`, `hcad`, `hoa`. `BodyType` is those plus `other`. `BodyIcon` and the quiz both use them. P1: if `bodies.type` should use different keys, change this file in one place.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (70/70, including a contrast test that fails if a base color drops white-on-denim, white-on-brick or ink-on-white below 4.5:1), typecheck, lint and build all pass.
  - In a browser, on a temporary sample page that was then deleted:
    - pill buttons (40px), cards 24px, inputs 44px pills
    - `rounded-2xl` 16px and `rounded-xl` 12px
    - Overpass loaded, all 13 `BodyIcon` types rendered
    - `TierPill` shows "Urgent" for `sms` only, and the input shows a denim focus ring
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Task 11 (site shell) is next.
  - Earlier note: GitHub repo secret `CRON_SECRET` and variable `APP_URL` are now set, for P2's scheduler.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 9: cron request check and schedules
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - `lib/cron.ts` has `isAuthorizedCron(req)` and `unauthorizedCronResponse()` (a 401 with a JSON error). If `CRON_SECRET` is unset, every request is rejected, including `Bearer undefined`.
  - `vercel.json` schedules both daily jobs (Hobby runs each at most once a day):
    - `/api/cron/ingest` at 12:00 UTC, about 6–8 AM Central. That stays clear of BoardBook's midnight–5 AM maintenance window.
    - `/api/cron/alerts` at 16:00 UTC, about 10 AM–noon Central, inside the 8 AM–8 PM quiet-hours window on both sides of Nov 1.
- **Files:** `lib/cron.ts`, `vercel.json`, `tests/platform/cron.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (P2 and P3, please read):**
  - Cron routes **export both `GET` and `POST`**. The first line of each is `if (!isAuthorizedCron(req)) return unauthorizedCronResponse()`.
  - Callers send `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`. Vercel cron does this itself.
  - **P2's GitHub Actions** command is `curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" "$APP_URL/api/cron/ingest"`, with `CRON_SECRET` as a repo secret and `APP_URL` as a repo variable.
  - Runs can be missed or fire twice, so make the jobs safe to repeat.
  - **Don't add a second `vercel.json`;** edit this one.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (64/64), typecheck and lint pass.
- **Open issues / next:** The GitHub `CRON_SECRET` secret and `APP_URL` variable are waiting on the owner's OK.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 8: signed `bodies_token` for results links
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `lib/tokens.ts` has two functions:
  - `signBodiesToken(ids)` signs a list of body IDs.
  - `verifyBodiesToken(token)` returns the IDs, or **null** if the token is missing, cut off, edited, signed with another secret, or in an unknown version.
- **Files:** `lib/tokens.ts`, `tests/platform/tokens.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (shared, §3):**
  - **Format:** `<payload>.<signature>`. The payload is base64url JSON `{"v":1,"b":[sorted unique ids]}`, and the signature is base64url HMAC-SHA256 with `BODIES_TOKEN_SECRET`.
  - **Body IDs:** 1 to 64 IDs, each matching `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`.
  - The same set always gives the same token, so P3 can cache the weekly page by token.
  - **P1** signs the token in `/api/lookup`. **P3** verifies it on `/weekly?t=`. When `verifyBodiesToken` returns null, show "enter your address again" instead of an error.
- **Checked:** `npm test -- tokens` (13/13), typecheck and lint pass.
- **Open issues / next:** Task 9 (the cron check and `vercel.json`) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 7: shared Gemini client
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** `lib/gemini.ts` is the one Gemini client for P2, P3 and P4.
  - `generateJson({ schema, contents, system?, model?, temperature?, timeoutMs? })` asks for structured JSON and returns it after validating it against your zod schema. Gemini receives the schema with `$schema` removed, temperature defaults to 0 and the timeout to 120 s.
  - **Errors:** a timeout throws `GeminiTimeoutError` (Google still bills a call cancelled on our side). Output that isn't JSON, or doesn't match the schema, throws `GeminiOutputError` with `issues` and `raw`.
  - **Models:** `geminiModel('default' | 'extract' | 'extract_fallback')` reads `GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-3.8-flash`) and `GEMINI_EXTRACT_MODEL` (falls back to the default). `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL` has no default, so leaving it unset throws.
  - **PDFs:** `pdfPart(bytes)` builds inline PDF data and throws `PdfTooLargeError` at 20 MiB or more.
  - **Testing:** `createGemini(fakeClient)` lets you test without the network.
- **Files:** `lib/gemini.ts`, `scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`, `tests/platform/gemini.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None. **P2:** per spec §6 this file exists, so use it instead of writing `lib/adapters/gemini.ts`. Pass `model: geminiModel('extract')`, and retry with `geminiModel('extract_fallback')` per D17.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (43/43), typecheck and lint pass. The live smoke test (`npx tsx scripts/gemini-smoke.ts`) is waiting on the paid `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Open issues / next:** Once the adult account owner has the paid key, add it to `.env.local` and Vercel and run the smoke test.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 6: deployed to Vercel
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **Live site: https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app.** Vercel project `showup-htx` on the `majority-illusion` team. A new "NeighborhoodHacks" team needed a payment method, so the owner chose the existing free team.
  - It's connected to the GitHub repo, so pushes to `main` deploy. Because the repo is private, deploys of teammates' commits wait for the owner's approval in Vercel.
  - Env vars are set for production and preview: `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SITE_URL`, `BODIES_TOKEN_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`, `IP_HASH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAILS` and `DEMO_MODE=false`.
  - Updated the README and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Files:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** `/`, `/about`, `/privacy` and `/terms` return 200 on production, and `/privacy` comes back in Spanish for `es-US`.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P3:** for Twilio registration, privacy is https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app/privacy and terms is https://showup-htx-six.vercel.app/terms. The contact link on them 404s while the repo is private.
  - **Still missing on Vercel:** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (the owner pastes it from the Supabase dashboard), the Gemini variables (once the paid key exists) and Twilio's (P3).
  - `ADMIN_EMAILS` has four of the five teammates; the fifth teammate's email is still needed.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 5: about, privacy and terms pages (English and Spanish)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added `/about`, `/privacy` and `/terms` in both languages. The privacy page covers everything the plan and Twilio need:
  - your address isn't saved
  - the cookies (`NEXT_LOCALE`, `showup_stakes`, `showup_bid`) and the hashed IPs
  - anonymous quiz answers
  - drafts sent to Google's Gemini API
  - the text program ("ShowUp HTX alerts," message frequency, "Msg & data rates may apply," STOP and HELP, parent consent under 18)
  - "we do not share your mobile number … for marketing"
  - the services that handle data (Supabase, Vercel, Google, Twilio)
  - news headline links

  Styling is plain for now; the design tokens arrive in P5 Task 10.
- **Files:** `app/(public)/{about,privacy,terms}/page.tsx`, `components/legal/LegalDocument.tsx`, `lib/brand.ts` (`APP_NAME`, `CONTACT_URL`), `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (32/32, including en/es message parity), typecheck, lint and build pass.
  - On a production server, all three pages return 200 and switch to Spanish for `es-MX`.
  - In a browser at 390px, none of the six page/language combinations scrolls sideways.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **The contact link (GitHub Issues) returns 404 for anyone logged out, because the repo is private.** Twilio's reviewers will hit that. P3: if Twilio asks for a working contact, we need a team email or a public repo before you submit.
  - The Spanish name for "Speak up" is "Habla" on these pages. P4, rename it if you choose another.
  - There's no favicon yet (it shows as a console 404); it comes with Task 10.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 4: English/Spanish translations and Chicago time
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - next-intl is set up without a language in the URL. The language comes from the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie, then the browser's `Accept-Language` header, then English (`pickLocale` in `lib/i18n.ts`).
  - Every page gets `timeZone: 'America/Chicago'`, and `<html lang>` follows the language.
  - `setLocale` (in `app/actions/locale.ts`) saves the choice.
- **Files:** `i18n/request.ts`, `lib/i18n.ts`, `app/actions/locale.ts`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/es.json`, `next.config.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/(public)/page.tsx`, `tests/platform/i18n.test.ts`, `tests/platform/messages.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None to the schema. **For every part:**
  - Put all screen text in both `messages/en.json` and `messages/es.json`, under your own top-level namespace (`Results`, `Weekly`, `SpeakUp`, `Alerts` and so on). Use `useTranslations('Ns')` in client components, or `await getTranslations('Ns')` on the server.
  - `npm test` fails if a key exists in only one file, if any message is empty, or if the `{placeholders}` differ between the two.
  - Format dates, times and money with next-intl (`useFormatter()` or `getFormatter()`). The Chicago time zone is already applied.
  - Pages are now rendered per request, because the language is read from the request.
- **Checked:**
  - `npm test` (32/32), typecheck, lint and `npm run build` pass.
  - On a live production server, `Accept-Language: es-US` gives `<html lang="es">` with the Spanish description, and `en-US` gives English. A `NEXT_LOCALE=es` cookie overrides an English header.
- **Open issues / next:** Task 5 (about, privacy and terms pages) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 3: env access and the server database client
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - `lib/env.ts` reads environment variables through `getEnv(name)`, which throws a clear `MissingEnvError`. It also has `getOptionalEnv`, `isDemoMode`, `isDemoRecord`, `adminEmails` and `assertServer`.
  - `lib/db.ts` exports `db()`, the one shared Supabase client with the secret key. It throws if anything calls it in a browser.
  - `.env.example` lists every variable and which part uses it.
- **Files:** `lib/env.ts`, `lib/db.ts`, `.env.example`, `tests/platform/env.test.ts`, `tests/platform/db.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** New env vars beyond §21 (plan files not edited):
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (admin sign-in)
  - `SITE_URL`
  - `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GEMINI_EXTRACT_MODEL` and `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL`
  - `IP_HASH_SECRET`, `DEMO_RECORD`
  - `SUPABASE_DB_URL` (local only)

  **Usage:** import `db` from `@/lib/db` in server code and scripts. It works under plain `tsx` too: load `.env.local` with dotenv first. Never import it into a client component. **P2:** your Phase 2 gate for `lib/db.ts` is met.
- **Checked:** `npm test` (17/17), `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` pass.
- **Open issues / next:** Ask P5 for the secret key and other values for your `.env.local`. They're never posted in the repo or chat.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 2: Supabase database is live (28 tables, RLS on everywhere)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - Created Supabase project `showup-htx` (ID `elsvhqqwdxwsuvkbchdq`, us-east-1, free plan; URL `https://elsvhqqwdxwsuvkbchdq.supabase.co`).
  - Applied the full §16 schema plus P2's additions in six migrations. Every table has RLS on with **no policies**, so the public key reads and writes nothing; only server code with the secret key can.
  - Generated types are in `lib/database.types.ts`.
- **Files:** `supabase/migrations/*.sql`, `lib/database.types.ts`, `tests/platform/migrations.test.ts`
- **Contract changes (shared; please read):**
  - **Keys:** `bodies.id` and `sources.id` are text slugs (e.g. `hcmud_489`). **P1: confirm your body slugs.** Every other table has a uuid `id`. Body foreign keys use `on update cascade`.
  - **Value lists** use text plus a `check` constraint, not Postgres enums. Examples: `items.status`, `tier`, `vote_result`, `review_status`; `sources.adapter` (`legistar | boardbook | primegov | llm_extract | manual`).
  - **New `items.source_id`** (not in §16): P2's upsert key `(source_id, external_id)` needs it. `meetings` has the same unique key.
  - **`items.review_status` is nullable,** because Legistar, BoardBook and manual items skip review. Suggested rule for P2 and P3: an item may text only when `tier = 'sms'` and `coalesce(review_status, 'approved') = 'approved'`.
  - **`alert_queue.item_id` and `alerts_sent.item_id` are nullable,** for the HCAD protest reminder. `alerts_sent` is `unique nulls not distinct (user_id, item_id, rule)`, so a reminder with no item still can't be sent twice; tested.
  - **Geometry** is `extensions.geometry(MultiPolygon, 4326)` for `boundaries.geom` (use `ogr2ogr -nlt PROMOTE_TO_MULTI`), and `Point` for centroids. PostGIS and pg_trgm live in the `extensions` schema.
  - **Loading order:** `hcad_jurisdictions.account` references `hcad_parcels`, so load parcels first.
- **How to add a migration:** write a new file in `supabase/migrations/` and ask P5 to apply it. P5 applies it through the Supabase connection and renames the file to the version the database records. Never `create policy`; `npm test` checks every migration for RLS.
- **Checked:**
  - In the database: 28 tables, 0 without RLS, 0 policies, extensions in `extensions`.
  - With the publishable key: reading `bodies` or `users` returns `[]`, and inserts get 401 or an RLS error.
  - `get_advisors` (security) shows only the expected "RLS enabled, no policy" notices.
  - `npm test` (6/6), `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` pass.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - **P1:** the free plan holds 500 MB, and a full HCAD load (about 1.5 million accounts, times their tax codes) likely won't fit. Load only the ZIPs the demo and the classmate survey need. For bulk loads, use the session-pooler connection string (Supabase dashboard → Connect) as a local-only `SUPABASE_DB_URL`.
  - P5 Task 3 (`lib/env.ts`, `lib/db.ts`) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P5 Task 1: root Next.js app and shared tooling
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** The real app now lives at the repo root, on Next.js 16.4.2, with Tailwind through `@tailwindcss/postcss`, vitest, ESLint and strict TypeScript, using the `@/*` → `./*` alias. `.gitattributes` forces LF line endings, and the root `.gitignore` keeps out `.env*`, `.next`, `.vercel` and the like. P5's full plan is in `.plans/p5-platform-plan.md`.
- **Files:** `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `app/`, `tests/`, `CLAUDE.md` (Commands), `AGENTS.md` (Next's rules block), `.plans/p5-platform-plan.md`
- **Contract changes:** None to the schema or types. **For P2:** the root `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs` and `vitest.config.ts` now exist.
  - Rebase `scrapper` onto `main` and add your dependencies and scripts (`test:live`, `scrape`, `news`) to these files rather than creating new ones.
  - `"type": "module"` is set. Your news-isolation `no-restricted-imports` rule is already in `eslint.config.mjs`.
  - `npm test` blocks `fetch`, so put live tests in a `vitest.live.config.ts`.
- **Checked:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (1/1) and `npm run build` all pass. `next dev` served `/` with status 200.
- **Open issues / next:** Task 2 (Supabase project and schema) is next.

### 2026-10-19: P2 scraper Phase 1 complete (steps 2–13)
- **Who:** Iarush · P2 Agenda Data
- **Branch:** scrapper
- **What changed:** Standalone scraper library (no DB, no Next.js): Legistar (Commissioners Court, HISD), BoardBook (CFISD), PrimeGov (City Council), LLM extraction (Lone Star, HC MUD 489) and manual YAML adapters; results from minutes; news headline collector, article fetcher and article→item matching; pure `health()`. Per-step details, smoke tables and a "Handoff to P5/P3" section are in `.plans/scraper-progress.md`. Also moved the step 0/1 entries, which had been inserted above this file's title, down here unchanged.
- **Files:** `lib/adapters/`, `lib/ingest/`, `lib/news/`, `scripts/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `.plans/scraper-progress.md`
- **Contract changes:** `Meeting`/`Item` per scraper spec §12.1 (`Item.status` upcoming|awaiting_result|decided, `Meeting` end_date/status/minutes_url/comment_rules_text, `vote_result` passed|failed|no_action, `AdapterResult.result_updates`). Additions: optional `is_demo` on Meeting/Item; `RunMode` results takes optional `known`; no `content_hash` on Item/Meeting types (computed at write time); `health()` returns `details`; redaction also covers embedded names and 3+ name lists ("several employees"). DB columns per spec P2-A (P5). Affects P3 and P5.
- **Checked:** npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm test (364 passed); live smoke of every source (table in progress log).
- **Open issues / next:** No GEMINI_API_KEY: all LLM fixtures hand-written, model ids unverified, live LLM smokes owed. Live BoardBook smoke and BoardBook results mode owed (session was in the 00:00–05:00 window). 5 outlets `fetch_articles: false` (terms of use); Houston Landing disabled. Phase 2 waits for P5's platform.

### 2026-10-19: P2 scraper step 1: shared types, ingest utilities, scrape CLI shell
- **Who:** Iarush · P2 Agenda Data
- **Branch:** scrapper
- **What changed:** Added the scraper's shared types (zod schemas for Meeting, Item, AdapterResult, news types), an HTTP helper, text/date normalization (America/Chicago), hashing, amount parsing, personnel redaction, section attribution, validation, a classify stub, the source registry with the news-domain guard, and the `npm run scrape` CLI shell (no adapters yet).
- **Files:** `lib/adapters/`, `lib/ingest/`, `scripts/scrape.ts`, `data/sources.yaml`, `tests/unit/`, `.plans/scraper-progress.md`
- **Contract changes:** `Meeting`/`Item` extended per scraper spec §5.1/§12 (end_date, status, minutes_url, comment_rules_text, body_id, section, description, amounts with optional `kind: 'rate'`, attachments, contains_private_person, quote_verified). Affects P3 and P5.
- **Checked:** npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm test (66 passed)
- **Open issues / next:** Step 2 (LegistarAdapter). `lib/rules/classify.ts` untouched (P3 owns it).

### 2026-10-19: P2 scraper step 0: root TypeScript project setup
- **Who:** Iarush · P2 Agenda Data
- **Branch:** scrapper
- **What changed:** Added a root Node/TypeScript project for the standalone scraper library (separate from `web/`): package.json scripts, strict tsconfig, vitest, eslint, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, and the progress log `.plans/scraper-progress.md`.
- **Files:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.live.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.plans/scraper-progress.md`, `tests/unit/setup.test.ts`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** npm run typecheck, npm run lint, npm test (1 passed)
- **Open issues / next:** P5 must merge root deps into the Next.js package.json later. Root configs exclude `web/`.

### 2026-10-19: Plan revision 5: news coverage perspectives
- **Who:** Iarush · part not set yet
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added a core feature, a "What news coverage says" block on weekly stories. It shows the viewpoints Houston outlets report on an agenda decision, grouped by stakeholder, each with a summary, an exact quote and a source link, plus a one-sided note. P2 now fetches article text from outlets with no paywall (stored admin-only, deleted after 90 days) and uses Gemini to match articles to items. P3 extracts viewpoints, runs code checks and a separate Gemini judge pass, and renders the block. News still never feeds items, classify, alerts, the review queue or story text; its only other effect is a weekly sort tie-breaker by outlet count.
- **Files:** `.plans/news-coverage-perspectives-spec.md` (new), `.plans/agent-scraper-spec.md` (v1.3: D27–D35, Steps 11b and 11c, P2-A, §10, §12), `Project_Plan.md`, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` (§1, §2, §6, new §9a, §10, §16, §19–§22)
- **Contract changes:** DB schema §16 gains `news_articles`, `news_article_items` (P2) and `item_perspectives` (P3), plus the existing D26 news tables. No news columns on `items`. The new env var `GEMINI_JUDGE_MODEL` affects P5. `Meeting`, `Item`, `bodies_token` and `classify()` are unchanged. The weekly sort order (§10) gains a last tie-break key, which affects P3.
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed.
- **Open issues / next:** TV station RSS feeds verified working on Oct 19 (KHOU, KPRC, ABC13, FOX 26). HPM, Community Impact and ABC13 block `Google-Extended` (Gemini) in robots.txt, and Click2Houston and FOX 26 block other AI crawlers. The owner chose the literal reading (scraper D36): obey only the `*` group or our own bot's group, so every outlet is fetched. P5 should prepare a pitch answer (scraper spec §12, item 22). Outlet terms of use are still unchecked, and Houston Landing still fails TLS. P5 needs to confirm the Gemini budget. P4's watchlist must find a real demo item with 2+ outlets covering it. Article storage is a copyright exposure the team accepted; recheck the outlets' terms.

### 2026-10-18: P4 registration, coaching and rehearsal
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · P4 Speak up
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Replaced generated speeches with a bilingual understand → register → user-authored draft → rehearse flow. Added six source-checked recipe records, Chicago/DST/method deadlines, verified-only written alternatives, browser progress, registration confirmation, guardrails with undo and optional server-side coaching. Calendar and news-watchlist findings are documented.
- **Files:** `web/src/app/app/speak/`, `web/src/app/api/coach/`, `web/src/components/speak/`, `web/src/lib/{registration,coach,speak}/`, `web/messages/`, `web/tests/`, `web/docs/p4-*.md`, `web/tsconfig.json`, `.plans/p4-implementation.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes:** No global data types, DB schema, Meeting/Item, bodies_token or classify changes. New P4-only registration and coach types; atomic RateLimitStore boundary awaits P5. Scope-local EN/ES messages await P5's global i18n provider.
- **Checked:** 71 tests, lint and TypeScript passed. Independent review fixes cover picker/API eligibility, method-specific cutoffs, policy-criticism near-misses, shared speaking targets and selected-method opening state. Live browser/API checks were blocked by approval capacity/socket permissions; live Gemini has no configured key.
- **Open issues / next:** See `web/docs/p4-status.md`. Teammate must verify MUD489's current participation rules and deliver a real comment; no submissions were made. P5/P3 must connect shared rate limits, real data, i18n and SMS reminders. Gemini uses native REST because SDK install approval failed. Original production-build limitations remain. No commit or push was attempted for P4.

### 2026-10-18: Plan revision 5: news "might come up" box (settled Iarush's way)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:**
  - **The news box:** for this one conflict, the owner sided with Iarush. P2's scraper spec (§12.12, D26) asked for the plan lines saying news is never a data source to change, so the plan files now say: news shows headline links on body pages labeled "may come up at a future meeting," and never feeds items, alerts or stories. The "In the news" box moved from stretch goals to the body pages. This is a one-time call, not a general rule that Iarush's documents override the owner's answers.
  - **Stress test:** it no longer interrupts agents running autonomously under a `.plans/` spec. They note it as pending and ask at the next interactive session.
- **Files:** `Project_Plan.md`, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` (§6), `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `plan_stress_test.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None. The news box's display contract is in the scraper spec's Step 11 (P1 renders it on body pages).
- **Checked:** Docs only. The scraper spec was not touched.
- **Open issues / next:** P5's privacy and terms pages should mention third-party news headlines and links (scraper spec §12.14).

### 2026-10-18: Added the plan stress test for every teammate
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added `plan_stress_test.md`: the questions from the owner's planning review, rewritten so each teammate's agent asks its own teammate once and records the answers here, with the owner's answers alongside for comparison. Added a root `AGENTS.md` so Codex, Cursor and other agents started at the root find the rules. `CLAUDE.md` and `web/AGENTS.md` now point to the stress test too.
- **Merged with teammates' pushes:**
  - BluePhoenix79's `CLAUDE.md` changes are kept: four palette bases including `--ink`, presets in `palette.ts`, and `npm test`.
  - Iarush's `.plans/agent-scraper-spec.md` (v1.2) is now treated as the authority for P2 in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and the stress test (Q11, Q12, Q15, Q16).
- **Files:** `plan_stress_test.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed. The plan files and the scraper spec were not touched.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Each teammate's agent should run the stress test at its next session. PlaidMod is already marked done.
  - BluePhoenix79 has been building in `web/`, but the owner says `web/` is test-only. Worth a direct conversation.
  - The scraper spec's §12.12 asks for three plan lines to change (the news "might come up" box), but the owner says not to change the plan files. The team needs to settle this.

### 2026-10-18: Planning review: owner's instructions, research, answers (plan files not changed)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · P5 Platform, Evidence and Pitch
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Went through the plan question by question, backed by research. Only this log, `CLAUDE.md` and `web/AGENTS.md` changed. The plan files were deliberately left as they are. **Where anything below differs from the plan (including part specs in `.plans/`), the plan wins until the team updates it.** This entry is longer than usual because the owner asked for everything to be recorded here.
- **Owner's standing instructions (apply to every agent):**
  - Follow `INSTRUCTIONS.md` no matter what. It stays unchanged.
  - The website in `web/` was only for testing. Don't build on it; follow the implementation plan. This settles the revision 4 Day 1 "prototype vs. plan" item. It also makes the tech plan's §17 table of prototype screens moot.
  - Don't change `Project_Plan.md` or `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` unless asked.
  - Gemini's 18+ terms: the team has this handled. Don't raise it.
- **Research facts (checked Oct 18):**
  - **Hackathon:** Neighborhood Hacks 2026 is online and for high schoolers. Teams of up to 5; each member registers on Devpost.
    - **Submissions close Fri Oct 23, 11:59 PM CST.** There's no live demo: judges see the Devpost write-up, a 2–6 min video and the public repo.
    - The write-up must answer "What is the specific problem, and how do you know it's real?"
    - Rubric: Community Relevance 25%, Impact 20%, Technical 20%, Creativity 15%, Presentation 10%, Accessibility 10%.
    - Rules §4: AI tools must be disclosed in the written description. §9: misrepresenting AI use can disqualify. https://neighborhoodhacks.org/rules/
  - **Twilio:** a trial account can send only preset templates, not custom alert text. Real alerts need a paid account plus Sole Proprietor 10DLC registration, which needs a real US mobile number, an address, and privacy and terms URLs. Campaign review can take several days. Twilio Verify works on a trial (verified numbers only).
  - **Vercel Hobby:** cron runs at most once a day, within ±59 min of the set time. Functions max out at 300 s.
  - **Gemini:** Google may use free-tier content and have humans review it; the paid tier doesn't. Current models are `gemini-3.8-flash` and `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. Structured JSON output is supported.
  - **Legistar:** `harriscountytx` and `houstonisd` both work without a token. HISD's data is complete. Commissioners Court's is missing upcoming meetings (Oct 29, Nov 12).
  - **Meetings before the deadline:**
    - CFISD, Mon Oct 19, 6 PM (sign up by noon Oct 19).
    - City Council, Tue Oct 20, 2 PM (sign up by 3 PM Oct 19).
    - HISD, Thu Oct 22, 5 PM. Its agenda is only five teacher employment hearings, so it's not suitable for the real comment.
    - **City Council's Tue Oct 27, 5 PM session already takes sign-ups on its online form, on any topic.**
    - Commissioners Court (Oct 29), HCC (Oct 28) and Lone Star (Nov 5) are all after the deadline.
- **Answers the owner agreed to (team notes; not in the plan):**
  1. The owner is P5. The name is ShowUp HTX.
  2. "Done" means the demo flow works end to end for the two demo addresses, plus the evidence. **After the demo flow works:**
     - the other four registration recipes
     - reminders 7a/7b and the protest reminder
     - the timeline
     - the "Why did I get this text?" page
     - health checks and the 45-day recheck
     - HISD Spanish agenda linking
     - the HOA top-50 list
     - Spanish coach tests
     - Port, METRO and water authority stories
  3. No classmate survey until the real lookup (Census + HCAD) works.
  4. The paid Gemini tier is owned by an adult (an 18+ teammate or a parent), along with any paid Twilio account.
  5. The Devpost write-up discloses AI use, and a teammate writes that section. This is the owner's answer to `INSTRUCTIONS.md`'s stop-and-ask rule.
  6. Schedule to the real deadline:
     - Mon: setup and checks.
     - Tue–Wed: build.
     - Thu: freeze at noon, fix bugs, record the video.
     - Fri: write-up; submit by 6 PM CST.
  7. A ~4 min video replaces the pitch slides and the backup video.
  8. All five teammates must be eligible and registered on Devpost. Confirm.
  9. Speak up may fill in only a factual opener (name, who you are, area, item). The user writes their position, experience, ask and closing.
  10. Build the new app at the repo root using the tech plan's §2 layout. Leave `web/` untouched, and delete it before submission once sohankamsala agrees.
  11. Carry over only the prototype's design system: `DESIGN.md`, color tokens, fonts and the shadcn components.
  12. Stay on Vercel Hobby, and trigger jobs by hand with `CRON_SECRET`.
  13. Use one model everywhere: `gemini-3.8-flash`.
  14. **Agenda data:**
      - Legistar for HISD.
      - Gemini extraction for the demo MUD.
      - Manual entry for everything else.
      - Skip PrimeGov.
      - Review items by flipping `review_status` in Supabase's table editor.
  15. **Real comment:** not HISD on Oct 22 (personnel hearings). Skip CFISD on Mon Oct 19 unless a CFISD teammate already has a topic.
- **Still open (owner unsure):**
  - Paid Twilio with Sole Proprietor registration, falling back to a labeled "preview" mockup.
  - Classmate survey Wed evening to Thu noon, with at least 10 people.
  - A teammate registering with the app for City Council on Oct 27, then speaking.
- **Files:** `agent_handoff.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`
- **Contract changes:** None.
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed. Research came from web sources and read-only API calls; nothing was registered or submitted.
- **Open issues / next:**
  - Revision 4 of the plan still lists "prototype vs. plan" as an open Day 1 item, and §17 still has the prototype-screen table. Both are settled or moot per the owner, but the plan text wasn't edited.
  - Iarush's `.plans/agent-scraper-spec.md` (v1.2) was pushed during this review and wins for P2. It replaces answer 14 (agenda data), the P2 parts of answers 2, 12 and 13, and the "Skip PrimeGov" line. Under the spec:
    - Sources: Legistar for Commissioners Court and HISD, BoardBook for CFISD, PrimeGov plus Gemini for City Council, Gemini for Lone Star and HC MUD 489, and YAML manual entry.
    - Scheduling: GitHub Actions every 30 minutes, with a daily Vercel backup.
    - Model: Flash, retrying on Pro when validation drops too many items.
    - Health checks and results-from-minutes are built in Phase 1.

### 2026-10-18: UI polish and palette studio
- **Who:** BluePhoenix79 · UI/platform (part not assigned)
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Improved dashboard hierarchy and phone layouts, widened news tiles at intermediate sizes, and added motion/focus polish. Expanded the existing dev picker into a six-preset palette studio with four editable tokens, validated saved colors, core contrast checks, CSS export and reset.
- **Files:** `web/src/app/`, shared UI components, `web/src/lib/palette.ts`, `web/tests/palette.test.mjs`, `web/DESIGN.md`, `web/docs/ui/`, `web/package.json`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Contract changes:** None to schema, Meeting/Item, bodies_token, classify, or data/types.ts. Design tokens now allow ink as a fourth editable palette base.
- **Checked:** Pulled through `839e4a5` with autostash; no conflicts. `npm test` (5 passed), `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` passed after pulling. Desktop palette/preset and Escape checked; phone dashboard and Brief inspected. Screenshots and detailed verification limits are in `web/docs/ui/README.md`.
- **Open issues / next:** Production builds previously failed on Google Fonts access and a CSS worker startup error. Browser persistence/clipboard checks remain unverified because approval tools timed out. Prototype/plan reconciliation remains open; scraper spec v1.2 overrides several parent-plan details and is not implemented by this UI change.

### 2026-10-18: Plan revision 4: rebalanced P5
- **Who:** PlaidMod · part not set yet
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** P5's Day 1 was overloaded, and every other part waits on it. Moved meeting calendar checks and the news watchlist to P4, Twilio registration to P3, and demo address picking to P1. Each part now converts its own screens' text for English/Spanish, and P5 only sets up the system. P5 does the database schema first on Day 1. Added a timing-risk note for the real public comment and a Day 1 "Everyone" decision on where the prototype and the plan disagree.
- **Files:** `Project_Plan.md`, `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` (§11, §17, §22)
- **Contract changes:** None. Ownership and schedule only; no schema, type or token changes.
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed.
- **Open issues / next:** P1, P3 and P4 each picked up a Day 1 task; check that your Day 1 still fits. The prototype vs. plan decision is still open.

### 2026-10-18: Added INSTRUCTIONS.md (binding agent rules)
- **Who:** PlaidMod · part not set yet
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, adapted from the owner's existing agent rules: no AI attribution anywhere (commits, PRs, docs, handoff entries), plus rules for when to commit or push. Removed the NASA-specific parts. `CLAUDE.md` now imports it and `web/AGENTS.md` points to it. Removed the "agent and model" field from this log's template to match.
- **Files:** `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `agent_handoff.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed.
- **Open issues / next:** If the hackathon's submission rules ask about AI use, that conflicts with `INSTRUCTIONS.md` §1. Agents must stop and ask rather than fill it in.

### 2026-10-18: Added agent guidance and this handoff log
- **Who:** PlaidMod · part not set yet
- **Branch:** main
- **What changed:** Added `CLAUDE.md` with commands, how the prototype is built, where it differs from the plans, and the design and neutrality rules. Added this log, and a rule in `CLAUDE.md` and `web/AGENTS.md` telling every agent to write an entry here.
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `agent_handoff.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`
- **Contract changes:** None
- **Checked:** Docs only; no code changed.
- **Open issues / next:** The prototype and Project_Plan rev 3 disagree on tier names, personas, county coverage, body list and route layout (see `CLAUDE.md`, "Prototype vs. plan"). The team needs to decide which side wins.
