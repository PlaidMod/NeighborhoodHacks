# Agent (Scraper): Part 2, Agenda Data

**Spec version:** 1.2, Oct 18, 2026.
- v1.1 added the scraper-related parts of plan commit `c4ca60b` ("News site plan update"): the `awaiting_result` status, recheck windows and results from minutes.
- v1.2 makes three changes:
  - the demo MUD is **HC MUD 489**
  - **HISD Spanish agendas are deferred** (§13)
  - a **news "might come up" collector** is added (D26). This **overrides** the plan's "news is never a data source" rule, in a limited way: news gives headline links on body pages only, never items, alerts or stories.
**Owner:** P2 (Agenda Data)
**Reader:** a coding agent (Claude Code or similar) working in long, autonomous sessions.
**Parent docs:** `Project_Plan.md` (what and why) and `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` §6, §7, §16, §20, §22 (how). Where this spec and those docs disagree, **this spec wins**. Every disagreement is listed in §12 so P5 and P3 can update their docs.

## 0. How to use this document

You are building the agenda scraper. It fetches meeting agendas from local governments, turns them into `Meeting` and `Item` records, and later writes them to Supabase for the weekly news page, SMS alerts and Speak up.

Work through the steps in §8 (Phase 1) in order. Each step ends with a **self-checkpoint** (§7). You are expected to run for a long time without a human. Don't ask for confirmation between steps.

**Stop only in these cases:**
1. **Phase 2 gate (hard stop).** When Phase 1 is complete, stop. Write a summary to the progress log and wait. Do not start Phase 2 (§9) until a human says P5's platform (Next.js, Supabase, schema) exists.
2. **Blocked step.** If the same checkpoint fails after **3 honest fix attempts**, mark the step `BLOCKED` in the progress log with the error output and what you tried. Then continue with the next step that doesn't depend on it. Stop only if every remaining step depends on a blocked one.
3. **Destructive or outward-facing actions.** Never `git push`, never force anything, never delete files you didn't create, and never send data to any service except the agenda sources, the RSS feeds in `data/news_feeds.yaml` (read-only GETs) and Gemini.

**When reality differs from this spec** (e.g. a field name changed, or a selector doesn't match): adapt, write a `DEVIATION` entry in the progress log saying what the spec said, what you found and what you did, then continue. Don't stop for deviations.

---

## 1. Git workflow

- Work on a local branch named **`scrapper`** (the spelling is intentional; use it exactly).
  - Step 0: `git checkout scrapper` if it exists, otherwise `git checkout -b scrapper` from `main`.
- **One local commit per completed step** (§7, checkpoint item 5). Message format: `p2: step N - <short summary>`.
- **Never push** to GitHub or any remote. Never run `git push`, `git push --force`, `git rebase` on shared history, or `git reset --hard`. The human pushes after review.
- Never commit secrets. `.env.local` must be in `.gitignore`.

## 2. Live findings (verified Oct 18, 2026)

These were checked against the real sources while writing this spec. Treat them as facts, but re-verify each one in its step's smoke test.

### Legistar (Commissioners Court `harriscountytx`, HISD `houstonisd`)
- **No API token needed** for either client. `GET https://webapi.legistar.com/v1/{client}/events` returns 200 with JSON.
- **CFISD is not on Legistar.** `cfisd` and `cyfair` both return "LegistarConnectionString setting is not set up".
- **Bodies:**
  - `harriscountytx`: 138 "Commissioners Court" and 223 "Commissioners Court - Special Meeting".
  - `houstonisd`: 205 "School Board" (active) and 138 "Board of Education" (active). Bodies 200 and 201 are inactive.
- **Event fields:** `EventId`, `EventBodyId`, `EventBodyName`, `EventDate` (midnight, date only), `EventTime` (`"9:00 AM"`), `EventAgendaStatusName` (`Final`, `Closed`, `Hidden`), `EventAgendaFile` (PDF URL, **often null**), `EventMinutesFile`, `EventComment` (`"CANCELLED"`, `"Special Meeting"`, `"Business Court Meeting"`, `"Hearings"`, `"TEST - DO NOT USE"`), `EventInSiteURL`, `EventVideoPath`, `EventLastModifiedUtc`.
- **Event item fields:** `EventItemId`, `EventItemAgendaNumber` (`"1."`, `"a)"`, or null), `EventItemAgendaSequence`, `EventItemTitle`, `EventItemMatterType` (e.g. `Financial Authorization`, `Contract - Award`, `Hearings Item`), `EventItemMatterId`, `EventItemMatterFile`, `EventItemActionName` (`approved`, `accepted`, `no action`, `motion failed`), `EventItemPassedFlagName` (`Pass` or null), `EventItemTally` (**always empty in samples**), `EventItemAgendaNote`, `EventItemMatterAttachments` (with `?Attachments=1`), `EventItemConsent`, `EventItemLastModifiedUtc`.
- **`eventitems` hits the 1,000-row cap too.** The Sept 17, 2026 Commissioners Court meeting (event 1242) returned exactly 1,000 rows. You **must paginate** `eventitems` with `$top`/`$skip`, not only `events`.
- **About 40% of rows are not agenda items.** They're section headers ("County Administration", "Management and Budget", "CLOSED SESSION", "HEARING ITEMS") and boilerplate ("Opening Prayer", the public-comment notice). Header rows have a null `EventItemAgendaNumber` and a null `EventItemMatterId`.
- **Vote results arrive weeks later.** Event 1244 (Oct 15) had 0 of 559 rows with a result on Oct 18. Event 1242 (Sept 17) had 527 `Pass` rows. **There are no vote tallies.** Treat `vote_result` as "passed or failed" only.
- **Commissioners Court calendar gap.** Legistar lists no Commissioners Court meeting between Oct 15, 2026 and Jan 14, 2027, except a hidden test event on Dec 31. Events through Dec 2027 already exist. More meetings may be added later. This matters for the health check (§9, P2-H).
- **The next HISD meeting (Oct 22, event 1332) is personnel hearings that name individual teachers.** Example: `"Natasha Smith, teacher, Twain Elementary School, Consideration of Independent Hearing Examiner's Recommendation…"`. See the redaction rule (§5.4).
- **Responses contain non-ASCII characters** (curly quotes, bullets, `\r\n`, tabs). Always decode as UTF-8.

### CFISD: BoardBook
- Organization listing: `https://meetings.boardbook.org/Public/Organization/668`. It's server-rendered HTML with no JavaScript needed, and lists meetings like `"October 19, 2026 at 6:00 PM - Regular Board Meeting"` and `"Meeting Type: Regular"` (also `Working`, `Special`).
- Agenda pages: `https://meetings.boardbook.org/Public/Agenda/668?meeting={id}`, linked from the listing as `/Public/Agenda/668?meeting=770676`.
- Agenda HTML uses classes `agenda-item-information agenda-item-children-of-{parentId}` (with `-0` for top level) and numbered items (`1.`, `4.A.`).
- **Nightly maintenance window: midnight to 5 AM Central.** Don't fetch BoardBook in that window.
- The next CFISD meeting is Oct 19, 2026 at 6:00 PM (Regular).

### Houston City Council: PrimeGov
- **Public meetings JSON, no auth:**
  - `GET https://houstontx.primegov.com/api/v2/PublicPortal/ListUpcomingMeetings`
  - `GET https://houstontx.primegov.com/api/v2/PublicPortal/ListArchivedMeetings?year=2026`
- Meeting fields: `id`, `committeeId` (1 = City Council), `dateTime` (`"2026-10-20T13:30:00"`, local time), `title` (`"October 20 & 21, 2026 - Houston City Council Session"`, so **a session spans two days**), `meetingState`, `videoUrl`, and `documentList[]` with `{id, templateName ("HTML Agenda" | "Agenda" | "HTML Packet" | "Packet"), compileOutputType (1 = PDF, 2 = ?, 3 = HTML), publishDate, language}`.
- **The agenda PDF downloads without auth:** `GET https://houstontx.primegov.com/Public/CompiledDocument/{documentId}` for the `templateName == "Agenda"` and `compileOutputType == 1` document. It returned `application/pdf`, 4.7 MB, for the Oct 20 session.
- **No JSON endpoint for items was found.** The HTML agenda document IDs returned "Document Not Found" through `/Public/CompiledDocument/{id}`, and `/Portal/MeetingPreview` needs a login. Items come from the PDF through LLM extraction.
- Use the "Agenda" document, never the "Packet" (the packet is much larger and contains backup material).

### Lone Star College: static PDFs
- Index: `https://www.lonestar.edu/board-agendas`. It's a static HTML list, with link text like `"October 1, 2026 Regular Meeting Including Tax Rate Public Hearing"` and relative `href`s under `/departments/chancellor/…pdf`.
- The page also contains links back to 2016. In `href` order, older links come first. **Filter by the date parsed from the link text**, not by position.
- Meetings are usually the first Thursday of the month. The Oct 1, 2026 meeting included a tax rate public hearing, which makes it a good golden fixture.

### Demo MUD: Harris County MUD 489 (`hcmud489.com`)
- **Index:** `https://hcmud489.com/board-meetings/`. It's a static page that lists agenda **and** approved-minutes PDFs together, as relative links under `/static/{hash}/…pdf`. Filename examples:
  - `Agenda_October_19_2026_HCMUD_489_5b93c39b1d.pdf`
  - `Special_Agenda_April_9_2026_HCMUD_489_….pdf`
  - `HARRIS_COUNTY_MUNICIPAL_UTILITY_DISTRICT_NO_489_NOTICE_OF_PUBLIC_MEETING_AGENDA_July_20_2026_….pdf`
  - `Agenda_September_21_2026_HCMUD_489_1_….pdf` (note the `_1` version suffix)
  - `Minutes_July_20_2026_Approved_HCMUD_489_….pdf`
- **Dates are in the filenames** (`Month_D_YYYY`, with underscores). Use `date_from: filename`.
- **Filenames can disagree by a day.** The May agenda says `May_19_2026`, but its minutes say `May_18_2026`. Match minutes to meetings with a ±2 day tolerance when exactly one meeting fits.
- **Schedule:** the board usually meets on the third Monday at 11:00 AM, at Schwartz, Page & Harding, 1300 Post Oak Blvd, Suite 2500, which is outside the district. Agendas are posted about a week ahead. The **next meeting is Oct 19, 2026**.
- **Minutes lag by one or two meeting cycles** because they're approved at the next meeting. On Oct 18, the Aug 17 (62 days) and Sept 21 minutes were not posted yet. The plan's 45-day results window is too short for this source, so it gets `results_max_days: 75` (§5.2).
- The site also has `/posts/…` meeting notices. They aren't needed, since the agenda PDFs are on the index page.
- The `/documents/` page has rate orders, audits and the tax-rate notice. **Don't scrape it.** Those are hand-entered by P1.

### News feeds (for the D26 "might come up" box only)
- **Houston Public Media:** `https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/feed/` is a working RSS 2.0 feed (40 items, with categories like `Houston`, `Harris County`, `Election 2026`). It also includes non-news shows (e.g. "Engines of Our Ingenuity"); those are filtered out by the body-term matching.
- **Community Impact:** `https://communityimpact.com/rss/` is a working **statewide** RSS feed (50 items: Dallas, Austin, Plano and so on). Filter it by link path to Houston-area editions (e.g. `/cy-fair/`). **Verify the edition slugs** from the live feed.
- **Houston Landing:** `https://houstonlanding.org/feed/` failed with a TLS/connection error from the probe machine. Retry; if it still fails, mark it `enabled: false` and log it.
- **Houston Chronicle:** no public RSS feed was found (`/rss/` returns 404) and the site is paywalled. **Excluded.**

### HISD Spanish agendas: DEFERRED (§13)
- The location wasn't found (`houstonisd.org/agenda` returned 404). **Don't work on this now.**

## 3. Decisions made in the interview

| # | Decision | Choice |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Who executes the spec | A coding agent with self-checkpoints; minimal human stops |
| D2 | Starting point | Standalone library first: no DB, no Next.js in Phase 1 |
| D3 | Phase 2 | **Hard stop** after Phase 1 until P5's platform exists |
| D4 | P2/P3 boundary | Ingest stops after upserting items and calling `classify()`; it sets `needs_story = true`. P3's own job writes stories. |
| D5 | Scheduler | GitHub Actions cron calls `/api/cron/ingest` every 30 minutes; a daily Vercel cron is the backup |
| D6 | Scanned PDFs | A text layer is required for auto-verification. Scanned docs: skip the quote check, mark items `quote_verified = false`, and send every item to the review queue regardless of tier. |
| D7 | CFISD | Deterministic `BoardBookAdapter` (HTML parsing, no Gemini) |
| D8 | City Council | `PrimeGovAdapter`: meetings from JSON (deterministic); items from the agenda PDF through the LLM extraction path |
| D9 | Personnel and closed-session items | Keep them and let them get stories so people know the session is happening, but **never store or show the private person's name**. Replace it with "an employee." |
| D10 | Flood Control and Port attribution | P2 assigns `body_id` at ingest from Legistar section headers, using a per-source config map |
| D11 | LLM item IDs | `external_id = sha1(meeting_external_id + normalized agenda_number)`, falling back to the first 80 normalized characters of the title. Skip re-extraction when the document's `content_hash` is unchanged. |
| D12 | Manual entry | YAML files in `data/manual/`, run through the same pipeline |
| D13 | Extra item fields | `amounts[]`, `section`, `description`, `attachments[]` |
| D14 | Self-checkpoints | typecheck, lint and tests green; a live smoke test per adapter; a progress log; a local commit per step |
| D15 | LLM link discovery | Config holds the index URL, a link regex and a date source. Code picks the PDFs; Gemini only sees the chosen documents. |
| D16 | Re-review | If an approved LLM item's `content_hash` changes and it still classifies as SMS-tier, it goes back to `pending` |
| D17 | Gemini model | Flash by default with structured output; retry once with Pro if validation drops more than 20% of items. Model names come from env vars. |
| D18 | Demo data | Out of scope for now. The team will make fake demo data later; `data/manual/` YAML is the intended path. Add an `is_demo` flag to the schema so it's ready. |
| D19 | Branch | Local branch `scrapper`, never pushed by the agent |
| D20 | Item status (plan `c4ca60b`) | Three states: `upcoming`, `awaiting_result` (the meeting has passed with no outcome posted), `decided` |
| D21 | Recheck windows (plan `c4ca60b`) | Meetings in the next 72 hours: every run. 3–30 days ahead: normal rotation. Past meetings with `awaiting_result` items: daily, up to `results_max_days` (default 45; **75 for HC MUD 489**), then a health flag. |
| D22 | Results from minutes (plan `c4ca60b`) | Legistar results come from `eventitems` refetches. LLM-extract, BoardBook and PrimeGov sources get results from minutes documents through a results-extraction mode. |
| D23 | HISD Spanish agendas (plan `c4ca60b`) | **Deferred** by the owner (v1.2). The design is kept in §13 for later. `Meeting.source_url_es` stays in the type, unused. |
| D24 | Official sources for all agenda data (plan `c4ca60b`) | Meetings, items, results and everything that feeds classify, stories or alerts come **only** from official government sources. Agenda sources with news domains are refused. Election results, Truth-in-Taxation rates and the HCAD protest deadline are **hand-entered by P1, not scraped**. |
| D25 | Demo MUD | **Harris County MUD 489** (`hcmud489.com`), through `llm_extract` with filename dates and minutes on the same index page |
| D26 | News "might come up" box (owner decision, v1.2) | A separate **news collector** reads RSS feeds only. It stores only the headline, outlet, link and date, matched to tracked bodies. It's shown on body pages as "In the news: may come up at a future meeting." It **never** creates items, never goes to classify, Gemini, stories, alerts or the review queue, and never stores article text. When a later agenda item matches, the mention links to it. |

## 4. Tech choices

- **Runtime:** Node 20+, TypeScript (strict), ES modules.
- **Packages (Phase 1):**
  - `zod`: schemas for every adapter's output and for the Gemini structured output.
  - `cheerio`: HTML parsing (BoardBook, Lone Star and MUD index pages).
  - `unpdf`: PDF text-layer extraction. It's serverless-friendly, so it works on Vercel later.
  - `@google/genai`: the official Google Gen AI SDK.
  - `yaml`: manual entry files and the source registry.
  - `luxon` (or `date-fns-tz`): `America/Chicago` time handling. All stored times are ISO 8601 with offset.
  - Dev: `typescript`, `tsx`, `vitest`, `eslint` with `typescript-eslint`, `dotenv`.
- **HTTP:** native `fetch`. Every request has a 30-second timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout`), a descriptive `User-Agent` (`NeighborhoodHacks-AgendaBot/0.1 (student civic project)`), and at most 2 retries with backoff on 5xx or network errors. Wait at least 500 ms between requests to the same host.
- **`package.json`:** if the repo has none, create a minimal one at the root with only P2's dependencies and these scripts: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `test:live`, `scrape`. Log in the progress file that P5 must merge it into the Next.js `package.json`. Don't run `create-next-app`; that's P5's job.
- **Secrets:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_EXTRACT_MODEL` (default: the current Flash model name), and `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL` (the current Pro model name) are read from `.env.local`. Create `.env.example` with placeholders. If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing, the LLM steps still get built and unit-tested against recorded outputs; only the live LLM smoke tests are skipped, with a log entry. **This is not a blocker.**

---

## 5. Contracts

### 5.1 Shared types (extends Technical Plan §6)

Put these in `lib/adapters/types.ts`. The fields marked **new** extend the agreed types; they're listed in §12 for the team.

```ts
export type Meeting = {
  external_id: string;            // stable per source (Legistar EventId, BoardBook meeting id, PrimeGov id, or hash)
  body_id: string;                // the body that holds the meeting (e.g. commissioners_court)
  date: string;                   // ISO 8601 with America/Chicago offset; includes the start time when known
  end_date?: string;              // new: for multi-day sessions (City Council "Oct 20 & 21")
  type: 'regular' | 'special';
  status: 'scheduled' | 'cancelled';  // new: Legistar EventComment "CANCELLED"
  agenda_url: string;             // human-viewable agenda (PDF or page)
  source_url_es?: string;
  video_url?: string;
  minutes_url?: string;           // new: Legistar EventMinutesFile, or a discovered minutes PDF
  comment_rules_text?: string;    // new: the agenda's public-comment / speaker instructions, verbatim (feeds comment_rules_changed)
};

export type Amount = { value: number; text: string };   // new: text is the exact substring the value came from

export type Item = {
  external_id: string;
  meeting_external_id: string;
  body_id: string;                // new on the type (already in the DB schema): the attributed body, e.g. flood_control
  agenda_number?: string;
  title: string;                  // redacted if contains_private_person
  section?: string;               // new: nearest header above the item, e.g. "Management and Budget"
  description?: string;           // new: agenda note or body text when the source has it (also redacted)
  matter_type?: string;
  status: 'upcoming' | 'awaiting_result' | 'decided';
  action?: string;
  vote_result?: 'passed' | 'failed' | 'no_action';
  amounts: Amount[];              // new: parsed in code, never by the LLM
  attachments: { name: string; url: string }[];   // new: links only, never parsed
  contains_private_person: boolean;  // new: true means a name was redacted (§5.4)
  source_url: string;
  source_quote?: string;          // LLM items only
  quote_verified?: boolean;       // new: LLM items only; false for scanned docs
};

export type AdapterResult = {
  meetings: Meeting[];
  items: Item[];
  documents: { url: string; fetched_at: string; content_hash: string; raw: string; kind: 'json' | 'html' | 'pdf_text' | 'llm_output' }[];
  result_updates: ResultUpdate[]; // new: outcomes found in minutes or refetches (mode 'results')
  warnings: string[];             // feeds the health check
};

export type ResultUpdate = {
  meeting_external_id: string;
  item_external_id: string;       // matched by code (§8, Step 10), never invented by the LLM
  action: string;
  vote_result: 'passed' | 'failed' | 'no_action';
  source_url: string;             // the minutes document
  source_quote?: string;          // LLM minutes only
  quote_verified?: boolean;
};

export type RunMode =
  | { kind: 'rotation' }                                   // window: today → +30 days
  | { kind: 'near_term' }                                  // window: now → +72 hours, every run
  | { kind: 'results'; meeting_external_ids: string[] };   // past meetings with awaiting_result items, up to results_max_days back

export interface Adapter {
  run(source: SourceConfig, mode: RunMode, window: { from: Date; to: Date },
      prev?: { documentHashes: Record<string, string> }): Promise<AdapterResult>;
}

// D26: news is a separate type and a separate module. It is NOT an Adapter and NOT part of AdapterResult.
export type NewsMention = {
  external_id: string;            // sha1(normalized url)
  outlet: string;                 // e.g. "Houston Public Media"
  headline: string;               // exactly as in the feed; no article text, no summary, no rewrite
  url: string;                    // the article link, shown to users
  published_at: string;           // ISO 8601
  body_ids: string[];             // tracked bodies it matched
  matched_terms: string[];        // which alias matched (for debugging and admin)
  forward_looking: boolean;       // headline suggests a future decision (sort key only)
};
export type NewsResult = { mentions: NewsMention[]; warnings: string[] };
```

**Status rule (all adapters), per plan `c4ca60b`:**
- `decided`: `action` or `vote_result` is present.
- `awaiting_result`: the meeting start is in the past and no outcome has been posted.
- `upcoming`: everything else.

Moving from `awaiting_result` to `decided` happens when a `ResultUpdate` is applied. SMS rules need `upcoming`, so a meeting already in progress is no longer alertable. Legistar items usually go straight to `decided` once results post, but they still sit in `awaiting_result` for the weeks before that (§2).

**Windows (D21):**
- `rotation`: today to 30 days ahead.
- `near_term`: now to 72 hours ahead. Commissioners Court can add supplemental items up to 72 hours ahead and emergency items up to 1 hour ahead.
- `results`: only the listed past meetings, up to the source's `results_max_days` back (default 45).

All windows are in `America/Chicago`. In Phase 1 the CLI exposes them as `--mode rotation|near_term|results`, and `--meetings id1,id2` for results mode.

### 5.2 Source registry

In Phase 1 this lives in `data/sources.yaml`; Phase 2 moves it into the `sources` table, with `config` as JSON. Shape:

```yaml

Before using them, confirm in the smoke tests that the `body_id` slugs match P1's `bodies` seed. If P1's seed doesn't exist yet, use these slugs and log them in §12's list.

**News guard (D24 + D26):** `registry.ts` rejects, with a clear error, any **agenda** source in `data/sources.yaml`, or any manual YAML, whose URL host (any of `index_url`, `minutes_index_url`, `source_url`, `agenda_url`) ends in a news domain. The blocklist starts with `communityimpact.com`, `houstonpublicmedia.org`, `houstonchronicle.com`, `chron.com`, `houstonlanding.org`, `khou.com`, `click2houston.com`, `abc13.com` and `fox26houston.com`. News domains are allowed **only** in `data/news_feeds.yaml`, which only the news collector (Step 11) reads. Unit-test both directions.

**Optional source fields** used above: `default_time`, `minutes_date_tolerance_days` (default 0), and `results_max_days` (default 45).

### 5.3 Classifier interface (P3 owns the implementation)

```ts
// lib/adapters/types.ts
export type Classification = { item_type: string; tier: 'sms' | 'weekly' | 'timeline'; rule_fired?: string };
export type Classifier = (item: Item, body: { id: string; sms_eligible: boolean; type: string }, taxRates: unknown) => Classification;
```

Phase 1 ships `lib/ingest/classifyStub.ts`, which returns `{item_type: 'other', tier: 'timeline'}`, plus a test that any `Classifier` can be swapped in. Never write logic into `lib/rules/classify.ts`; that's P3's file.

**Contract with P3:** items with `contains_private_person = true` or `section` matching closed session **must** get a story (D9) and must **never** be SMS-tier. Add this to §12.

### 5.4 Redaction (D9)

`lib/ingest/redact.ts` exports `redactPersonnel(item): Item`. Run it on **every** item from **every** adapter before anything else sees the item.

**When it applies.** An item is personnel-sensitive if any of these are true:
- `matter_type` matches `/hearing|grievance|personnel|termination|nonrenewal|appeal/i`
- `section` matches `/closed session|executive session|hearing items|personnel/i`
- `title` matches `/hearing examiner|proposed termination|nonrenewal|grievance|level (iii|3) appeal/i`

**What it does:**
- Replace a leading person-name segment with `An employee`. The pattern is up to 4 capitalized tokens (hyphens and apostrophes allowed) followed by a comma and a role word (`teacher`, `employee`, `principal`, `aide`, `counselor`, `coach`, `nurse`, `librarian`, `student`, `parent`). Example:
  `Natasha Smith, teacher, Twain Elementary School, Consideration of…` → `An employee, teacher, Twain Elementary School, Consideration of…`
- **Also remove the school name** from these items. A school plus a role can identify a person. The result is: `An employee, Consideration of…`.
- Apply the same rule to `description` and `source_quote`.
- Set `contains_private_person = true`.
- Closed-session items with no name (e.g. "Deliberate the duties of the superintendent…") are left as they are, with `contains_private_person = false`.

**Rules:**
- Redaction runs **after** the quote check (so the quote is checked against the original text) and **before** hashing and storage.
- The raw document in `documents.raw` keeps the original public record. It's admin-only (RLS, no anon access). Never send it to Gemini for story writing.
- The LLM extraction prompt (§8, step 7) also tells Gemini to write "an employee" for any private individual. The code redaction is the guarantee; the prompt is a second layer.
- Public officials in their public role (board members, the superintendent, commissioners) are **not** redacted.

**Tests:** all 5 hearing items from HISD event 1332 must come out with no personal name and no school name. Near-misses that must be kept: "Approve the superintendent's employment contract" and "Board member Jane Doe requests a report on…".

### 5.5 Hashing

- `item.content_hash = sha256(normalize(title) | status | action | vote_result | amounts.map(a => a.value).join(','))`.
  - This extends the plan's title + status + action. Amount changes matter for bonds.
- `meeting.content_hash = sha256(date | end_date | status | type)`. **This is how P3's `meeting_moved` rule detects a date change.**
- `document.content_hash = sha256(raw bytes or response text)`.
- `normalize()` means: Unicode NFKC, curly quotes to straight, collapse whitespace, trim, lowercase.

### 5.6 Amount parsing

`lib/ingest/amounts.ts` exports `parseAmounts(text): Amount[]`. It must handle:
- `$322,895.36`
- `$1,685,000`
- `$14 million`, `$14.5 million`, `$2 billion`
- `$14M`
- tax rates: `$0.3891 per $100` and `0.389100`, tagged as rate amounts with `{value, text, kind: 'rate'}`; add `kind` to `Amount`

It returns the exact substring in `text`. Unit-test it with at least 15 real strings taken from the Legistar fixtures.

## 7. Self-checkpoint (run at the end of every step)

1. `npm run typecheck`: zero errors.
2. `npm run lint`: zero errors. Warnings are allowed but should be logged.
3. `npm test`: all tests green. **No test may hit the network.** Live calls only happen under `npm run test:live` and `npm run scrape`.
4. **Live smoke test**, for adapter steps only: run `npm run scrape -- --source <id> --out tmp/scrape`, then assert:
   - at least 1 meeting in the window, or a logged explanation (e.g. the Commissioners Court gap)
   - every item has a non-empty `title`, `source_url` and `external_id`
   - no duplicate `external_id` within a source
   - every date parses and falls inside the window
   - no item with `contains_private_person = true` still contains a name that matches the redaction pattern
   - **running the scrape twice gives identical `external_id` sets** (idempotency)

   Then save the raw responses as new golden fixtures with `--record`. Trim fixtures over 1 MB (keep the first N events or items) and note the trimming in the fixture's README.
5. **Progress log:** append to `.plans/scraper-progress.md`:
   ```
   ## Step N: <name>: DONE | BLOCKED | DONE WITH DEVIATIONS
   - What was built:
   - Checks: typecheck ✔ lint ✔ tests ✔ (X passed) smoke ✔ (meetings: A, items: B)
   - DEVIATION: <spec said / found / did>   (if any)
   - Notes for P3/P5:                          (if any)
   ```
6. **Local commit:** `git add -A && git commit -m "p2: step N - <summary>"` on branch `scrapper`. Never push.

---

## 8. Phase 1: standalone library (no database, no Next.js)

### Step 0: Setup
- Switch to or create branch `scrapper` (§1).
- Create `package.json` if it's missing (§4), `tsconfig.json` (strict, `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`, path alias `@/*`), `vitest.config.ts`, an eslint config and `.env.example`. Add `tmp/`, `.env.local` and `node_modules/` to `.gitignore`.
- Create `.plans/scraper-progress.md` with a header and the date.
- **Checkpoint:** typecheck and test pass on an empty test, then commit.

### Step 1: Types, utilities and the CLI shell
- Write `types.ts` with zod schemas mirroring §5.1. Every adapter's output gets validated with `AdapterResultSchema.parse()` in the CLI.
- Write `http.ts`, `normalize.ts`, `hash.ts`, `amounts.ts`, `redact.ts` (rules only; the HISD fixture tests come in Step 3), `attribution.ts`, `validate.ts`, `classifyStub.ts` and `registry.ts`.
- Write `scripts/scrape.ts`. It loads the registry, runs one adapter and writes `meetings.json`, `items.json` and `warnings.json` to `--out`. With `--record`, it also writes the raw documents into the matching `tests/golden/<adapter>/` folder.
- **Tests:** amounts (15+ cases), normalize, hash stability (the same input always gives the same hash), and America/Chicago conversion across the DST change on Nov 1, 2026 (a 9:00 AM meeting on Nov 5 must be `-06:00`).
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 2: LegistarAdapter
- **Events:**
  - `GET /v1/{client}/events?$filter=EventDate ge datetime'{from}' and EventDate lt datetime'{to}'&$orderby=EventDate`, filtered to the config's `body_ids`.
  - Page with `$top=1000&$skip=n` until a page returns fewer than 1,000 rows.
  - Drop events whose `EventAgendaStatusName` is in `exclude_agenda_status`, or whose `EventComment` matches `exclude_comment_patterns`.
- **Meeting mapping:**
  - `external_id = String(EventId)`
  - `date` = `EventDate` (date part) + `EventTime`, in America/Chicago
  - `type = 'special'` if the body is 223 or `EventComment` matches `/special/i`; otherwise `'regular'`
  - `status = 'cancelled'` if `EventComment` matches `/cancel/i`
  - `agenda_url = EventAgendaFile ?? EventInSiteURL` (**the agenda file is often null**)
  - `video_url = EventVideoPath`
  - `minutes_url = EventMinutesFile`
- **Modes (§5.1):**
  - `near_term` and `rotation` use the event date filter.
  - `results` skips the events query and refetches `eventitems` only for the listed event IDs. Any item that now has `ActionName` or `PassedFlagName` becomes a `ResultUpdate`, with `source_url` = `minutes_url ?? EventInSiteURL`. Legistar needs no LLM for results.
- **Items:**
  - `GET /v1/{client}/events/{id}/eventitems?AgendaNote=1&Attachments=1&$top=1000&$skip=n`, paginated. **This is required:** event 1242 has 1,000 or more rows.
  - Sort by `EventItemAgendaSequence`.
  - Walk the rows in order and track `currentSection`. A row with a null `EventItemAgendaNumber` and a null `EventItemMatterId` is a header: set `currentSection` to its title. Very long header-like rows (over 200 characters, e.g. the public-comment notice) are boilerplate: don't make them the section, and don't emit them as items.
  - Emit an item only when `EventItemAgendaNumber` or `EventItemMatterId` is non-null.
  - **Comment rules:** boilerplate rows (no number, no matter id) whose text matches `/public comment|address (the )?(court|board)|speak(er|ers)? |appearance|sign(ed)? up|register|zoom|live video/i` are joined in sequence order into `meeting.comment_rules_text`. Examples: the Commissioners Court "Members of the public may attend, participate and/or address…" row, and HISD's "Public comment during School Board meetings will only be available…" rows. They're still not emitted as items.
- **Item mapping:**
  - `external_id = String(EventItemId)`
  - `agenda_number` = trimmed, with trailing `.` removed
  - `title = EventItemTitle`
  - `section = currentSection`
  - `description = EventItemAgendaNote` (with HTML stripped)
  - `matter_type` = trimmed (the source has trailing spaces, e.g. `"Asset Management "`)
  - `action = EventItemActionName`
  - `vote_result`: `'passed'` if `PassedFlagName == 'Pass'`; `'failed'` if the action matches `/fail/i`; `'no_action'` if the action is `'no action'`
  - `attachments` from `EventItemMatterAttachments` (`MatterAttachmentName` and `MatterAttachmentHyperlink`)
  - `source_url` = the meeting's `agenda_url`
  - `amounts = parseAmounts(title + ' ' + description)`
- **Attribution:** `body_id` = `section_body_map[currentSection]` (also check parent sections; keep a header stack) or else the source's `body_id`.
- **Then:** run `redactPersonnel`, then compute hashes.
- **Warnings:** a page hit 1,000 rows (expected, but log it), an event has 0 items, or a non-header row has an empty title.
- **Golden fixtures** (record them live):
  - `harriscountytx` 1244 (Oct 15, no results yet; 559 rows)
  - `harriscountytx` 1242 (Sept 17, has results, 1,000+ rows, so it tests pagination)
  - `harriscountytx` 1243 (cancelled)
  - `houstonisd` 1306 (Oct 8, regular)
  - `houstonisd` 1332 (Oct 22, hearings, so it tests redaction)

  For each one, write an `expected.json` with the item count, 5 spot-checked items (title, number, section, status, vote_result), all attribution hits and all redacted titles. The tests compare against the saved responses.
- **Status test:** with a frozen clock of Oct 18, 2026, the event 1244 items are `awaiting_result`. Then feed in a hand-edited copy of the 1244 fixture with `ActionName: approved` on 3 items (`results` mode). It must produce exactly 3 `ResultUpdate`s.
- **Smoke:** both sources. Expect the Commissioners Court window to have 0 upcoming meetings (§2), which is fine: log it, and smoke-test it with `--from 2026-09-01` too.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 3: Redaction against real data
- Run `redactPersonnel` on the HISD 1332 golden fixture, and finish the tests from §5.4.
- Grep every fixture's output for redaction leaks. Write a test that fails if any item with `contains_private_person` has two or more consecutive capitalized non-stopword tokens before the first comma.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 4: BoardBookAdapter (CFISD)
- **Listing:** fetch `/Public/Organization/{org_id}`. Parse each meeting block: the title line (`"{Month D, YYYY} at {h:mm AM/PM} - {Name}"`), `Meeting Type: {Regular|Working|Special}`, and the `/Public/Agenda/{org}?meeting={id}` link.
  - `external_id` = the meeting id
  - `type`: Special → `'special'`; Regular and Working → `'regular'` (put the name in the warnings if it's unusual)
- **Agenda page:** walk the agenda tree in DOM order.
  - Top-level entries (`agenda-item-children-of-0`) are sections: e.g. "MEETING OPENING", or numbered sections like "4. Recognitions and Awards Announcements". A section can be an item too, if it has no children.
  - Child entries are items: `agenda_number` = the full outline number (`4.A`), `title` = the item text, `section` = the parent's text.
  - Collect attachment links under each item.
  - `external_id` = BoardBook's item id if one is in the DOM (look for `agenda-item-children-of-{id}` or a `data-*` id); otherwise `sha1(meeting_id + agenda_number)`.
- `source_url` = the agenda page URL. `agenda_url` = the same, or the "Download" PDF link if one is present.
- **Don't run between 00:00 and 05:00 Central:** the adapter returns a warning and no data.
- **Minutes:** for each meeting, record a minutes link if the listing or agenda page shows one, as `minutes_url`. Step 10 consumes it in `results` mode.
- **Comment rules:** set `meeting.comment_rules_text` from the agenda's notice or intro text, and from any item whose title matches the Step 2 comment-rules pattern (e.g. "Public Comments" / "Hearing of Citizens" sections plus their child text).
- **Inspect before writing selectors.** Save one listing and one agenda page, inspect the actual DOM, then write the selectors. The structure in §2 comes from a quick probe and may be incomplete.
- **Golden fixtures:** the listing, plus the Oct 19, 2026 Regular agenda and the Oct 8, 2026 Work Session agenda.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 5: Discovery and PDF text (LLM-extract groundwork)
- `discover(config, window)`: fetch `index_url` with cheerio and collect `<a>` elements whose `href` matches `link_pattern`. Resolve relative URLs.
  - Parse the date from the link text (or the filename if `date_from: filename`). Accepted formats: `October 1, 2026`, `Oct. 1, 2026`, `10/1/2026`, `10-01-26`, `2026-10-01`, filenames like `1710 October 2017 Board Agenda`, and **underscore filenames** like `Agenda_October_19_2026_HCMUD_489_5b93c39b1d.pdf`. Ignore the trailing hash and the `_1` version suffix when parsing.
  - Keep only links inside the window. Deduplicate by URL.
  - **Several agenda PDFs for one date** (e.g. a `_1` revision): keep the one with the highest version suffix, or the last one on the page if there are no suffixes, and log a warning. The other PDF is still stored as a `document`.
  - With `follow_notice_page: true`: links point to notice pages; fetch each one and take its first PDF link.
- `getText(pdfBytes)`: extract the text with `unpdf`, per page.
  - A document has a **usable text layer** if at least 200 non-whitespace characters per page on average **and** at least 60% of pages have more than 50 characters. Otherwise it's **scanned** (D6).
  - Store the text as a `document` with `kind: 'pdf_text'`.
- **Golden fixtures:** the Lone Star index page, the HC MUD 489 `/board-meetings/` page, the Oct 1, 2026 Lone Star agenda PDF, and the Oct 19, 2026 MUD 489 agenda PDF. For PDFs, store the **extracted text** and a sha256 of the PDF; store the PDF itself only if it's under 1 MB.
- **Tests:** date parsing (10+ formats, including the 4 MUD 489 filename styles in §2), window filtering on the real Lone Star index (the 2016–2017 links must be excluded), MUD 489 agenda and minutes links separated correctly, the `_1` revision rule, and text-layer detection. Make a scanned-PDF fixture by rendering one page as an image-only PDF, or use any small image-only PDF you create.
- **Checkpoint** (smoke: Lone Star discovery finds the Oct 1 PDF when the window includes it; MUD 489 discovery finds `Agenda_October_19_2026`. Also record whether the MUD 489 PDFs have a text layer), then commit.

### Step 6: Gemini client and extraction schema
- `lib/adapters/gemini.ts` (if P5 already created `lib/gemini.ts`, use theirs and log it):
  - The model comes from `GEMINI_EXTRACT_MODEL`.
  - Use structured output with a JSON schema generated from zod.
  - Timeout: 120 s for extraction.
  - Temperature: 0.
- **Extraction output schema:**
  ```ts
  { meeting: { date: string; time?: string; type: 'regular'|'special'; title?: string;
               comment_instructions_quote?: string },   // verbatim public-comment / speaker instructions, if the agenda has them
    items: { agenda_number?: string; title: string; section?: string; description?: string; source_quote: string }[] }
  ```
  The LLM does **not** produce amounts, status, IDs or `body_id`. Code fills those in.
- **Prompt rules:**
  - Extract every numbered or clearly separate agenda item.
  - `source_quote` must be copied exactly from the text, 20–200 characters, and must include the item's distinctive words.
  - Never invent items.
  - Write "an employee" in place of any private individual's name.
  - Don't summarize; use the agenda's own wording for `title`.
  - Skip boilerplate (call to order, pledge, adjourn) unless it's numbered.
- **Input:**
  - With a text layer: send the **extracted text**, not the PDF. It's cheaper, and the quote check runs against exactly what the model saw.
  - Scanned: send the PDF bytes inline (under 20 MB) or through the Files API.
- **Chunking:** if the text is over about 150k characters (a City Council PDF can be large), split on page boundaries into chunks of about 100k characters with a 1-page overlap. Extract from each chunk and merge, deduplicating by `external_id`.
- **Golden tests use recorded outputs.** `tests/golden/llm-extract/<case>/` holds `source.txt`, `gemini_output.json` (recorded with `--record` when a key is available, or hand-written to match the schema when it isn't), and `expected.json`. Unit tests never call Gemini.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 7: LLMExtractAdapter with validation
- **Pipeline per document:**
  1. discover
  2. fetch
  3. compute the `content_hash`; **if it equals `prev.documentHashes[url]`, skip the document** (D11)
  4. getText
  5. Gemini (Flash)
  6. validate
  7. if more than 20% of items were dropped, retry once with `GEMINI_EXTRACT_FALLBACK_MODEL` and keep whichever run has more valid items (D17)
  8. map
  9. redact
  10. hash
- **Validation in code** (`validate.ts`):
  - **Quote check** (text-layer docs only): `normalize(source_quote)` must be a substring of `normalize(fullText)`, using the §5.5 normalization plus hyphenation repair (`-\n` → ``). Items that fail are dropped, with a warning showing the quote. For scanned docs, skip the check and set `quote_verified = false` on every item.
  - **Date:** a real date within 60 days of today. If the date from the link text and the date the LLM returned disagree, trust the link-text date and log a warning.
  - **Title:** non-empty, under 2,000 characters.
  - **Comment instructions:** `comment_instructions_quote` gets the same quote check. If it passes, it becomes `meeting.comment_rules_text`; if it fails, it's dropped with a warning.
  - **Amounts:** parsed by code from the title and description. If an LLM description contains a `$` figure that isn't also in `fullText`, drop that description and log a warning.
- **Mapping:**
  - `meeting.external_id = sha1(source_id + date)`
  - `item.external_id = sha1(meeting_external_id + normalize(agenda_number))`, or `sha1(meeting_external_id + normalize(title).slice(0, 80))` when there's no number
  - On an `external_id` collision within a meeting, append `#2`, `#3` in document order, and log a warning.
  - `source_url` = the PDF URL. `status` follows §5.1.
- **Fixtures** (record when a key is available):
  - the Lone Star Oct 1, 2026 meeting (tax rate hearing)
  - the HC MUD 489 Oct 19, 2026 agenda (plus one earlier MUD 489 agenda, e.g. Special_Agenda April 9, 2026)
  - one City Council PDF chunk
  - **5 deliberately corrupted outputs:** a fake quote, a quote with one changed number, an out-of-window date, an empty title, and an LLM description with an invented dollar figure. All five must be rejected.
- **Checkpoint** (smoke only when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present), then commit.

### Step 8: PrimeGovAdapter (City Council)
- **Meetings:** `ListUpcomingMeetings` plus `ListArchivedMeetings?year={yyyy}` (and the previous year when the window crosses January). Filter by `committeeId == config.committee_id` and by the window.
  - `external_id = String(id)`
  - `date` = `dateTime` in America/Chicago
  - `end_date`: parse `"October 20 & 21, 2026"`-style titles; when it's a two-day session, set the second day
  - `type`: `/special/i` in the title → `'special'`
  - `video_url = videoUrl`
- **Agenda document:** pick the `documentList` entry with `templateName == config.document_template` (`"Agenda"`) and `compileOutputType == 1`, and the newest `publishDate` if there are several. The document URL is `/Public/CompiledDocument/{doc.id}`; that's `agenda_url`.
- **Items:** hand the PDF to the Step 7 path (getText → Gemini → validate), with the meeting already known. Pass the meeting to the extractor so Gemini only returns items; ignore its meeting fields.
- **Skip unchanged documents:** the content hash is the PDF sha256.
- **No document published yet:** emit the meeting with zero items and a warning `agenda_not_published`. That's normal more than 72 hours out.
- **Minutes:** if an archived meeting's `documentList` has a minutes document (`templateName` matching `/minutes/i`), set `minutes_url` to `/Public/CompiledDocument/{id}`. Step 10 consumes it.
- **Golden fixtures:** the upcoming and archived JSON, plus the extracted text of the Oct 20, 2026 agenda (doc 6914). Don't commit the 4.7 MB PDF.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 9: ManualAdapter
- **Format:** `data/manual/{body_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.yaml`.
  ```yaml
  meeting:
    body_id: hcmud_489
    date: "2026-10-28T10:00:00-05:00"
    type: regular
    agenda_url: https://…        # required
  items:
    - agenda_number: "5"
      title: "Consider order calling a $14,000,000 bond election"
      section: "Bonds"
      source_url: https://…      # required
  is_demo: false                 # D18: true for the team's fake demo data later
  ```
- `external_id = sha1('manual' + file path + agenda_number or title)`.
- The items go through the same amounts, redact and hash steps. Missing `source_url` or `agenda_url` is a validation error that names the file and line.
- Commit **one** example file that's clearly a format example: `data/manual/_example/…`, which the registry skips because the directory starts with `_`. **Don't create demo data** (D18).
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 10: Results from minutes (`results` mode, D22)
This step is for sources whose outcomes appear only in minutes: LLM-extract (MUD, Lone Star), BoardBook and PrimeGov.
- **Input:** past meetings that still have `awaiting_result` items, plus their known items (in Phase 1, from a saved `items.json`; `--meetings` selects them).
- **Find the minutes:**
  - use `meeting.minutes_url` if it's set
  - otherwise run discovery on `minutes_index_url` with `minutes_link_pattern`, matched to the meeting by the parsed date: an exact date first, then within `minutes_date_tolerance_days` if exactly one meeting fits (MUD 489: agenda `May_19` vs minutes `May_18`), with a warning
  - no minutes yet → no updates and no error (that's normal)
- **Extract:** `getText`, then Gemini with this schema:
  `{ outcomes: { agenda_number?: string; title_fragment: string; outcome: 'passed'|'failed'|'tabled'|'no_action'; source_quote: string }[] }`
  Map `tabled` to `no_action`, and put `tabled` in `action`.
- **Match in code:** first by normalized `agenda_number`. Otherwise use the best trigram or token overlap between `title_fragment` and the existing item titles in that meeting, with a threshold of 0.5. Ties or no match → warning, no update. **Never create new items from minutes.**
- **Validate:** the same quote check as Step 7. For scanned minutes, set `quote_verified = false`; Phase 2 sends those updates to the review queue.
- **Fixtures:**
  - the real HC MUD 489 `Minutes_July_20_2026_Approved` PDF, matched to the `NOTICE_OF_PUBLIC_MEETING_AGENDA_July_20_2026` agenda items
  - the MUD 489 May pair (agenda 19th, minutes 18th), which tests the date tolerance
  - one corrupted output with a fake quote (must be rejected)
  - one outcome for an item that doesn't exist (must not create an item)
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 11: News "might come up" collector (D26)
**Purpose:** show residents on a body's page that a topic is in the news and **may** come up at a future meeting, before it reaches an agenda. **It's a pointer to journalism, not data.**

- **Isolation (enforce in code):**
  - `lib/news/` is its own module and returns `NewsResult`, never `AdapterResult`, `Item` or `Meeting`.
  - Add an eslint `no-restricted-imports` rule so `lib/adapters/**` and `lib/ingest/**` **cannot import** `lib/news/**`.
  - Add a test that `NewsMention` isn't assignable to `Item` (a `// @ts-expect-error` assignment).
  - **No Gemini** anywhere in `lib/news/`.
- **Feeds** (`data/news_feeds.yaml`), **RSS only**. Never fetch article pages, never get around paywalls.
  ```yaml
  - { outlet: Houston Public Media, url: https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/feed/, enabled: true }
  - outlet: Community Impact
    url: https://communityimpact.com/rss/
    link_path_allow: ["/cy-fair/", "/houston/", "/heights-river-oaks-montrose/", "/bellaire-meyerland-west-university/",
                      "/spring-klein/", "/tomball-magnolia/", "/katy/", "/lake-houston-humble-kingwood/"]   # verify slugs live
    enabled: true
  - { outlet: Houston Landing, url: https://houstonlanding.org/feed/, enabled: true }   # failed TLS on Oct 18; disable if it keeps failing
  # Houston Chronicle: excluded (no public RSS found, paywalled)
  ```
- **Parse** with cheerio in XML mode (or `fast-xml-parser`). Per item, take `title`, `link`, `pubDate`, and `description`/`category`. Keep only items from the last 14 days.
- **Matching** (`lib/news/match.ts`, deterministic):
  - Each tracked body in `data/news_terms.yaml` has `aliases` and `exclude_terms`. Starting set:
    - `commissioners_court`: aliases `["Harris County Commissioners Court", "Commissioners Court", "County Judge"]`; exclude `["Fort Bend", "Montgomery County", "Galveston", "Brazoria", "Dallas", "Travis", "Bexar", "Collin", "Denton", "Williamson"]`
    - `flood_control`: `["Harris County Flood Control", "Flood Control District", "HCFCD"]`
    - `port_houston`: `["Port of Houston", "Port Houston", "Port Commission"]`
    - `hisd_board`: `["HISD", "Houston ISD", "Houston Independent School District", "board of managers"]`
    - `cfisd_board`: `["Cy-Fair ISD", "CFISD", "Cypress-Fairbanks"]`
    - `houston_city_council`: `["Houston City Council", "City Council"]`; the bare "City Council" alias only counts if the feed item also contains "Houston"
    - `lone_star_board`: `["Lone Star College"]`
    - `hcmud_489`: `["MUD 489", "Municipal Utility District No. 489", "HCMUD 489"]`
  - Match whole words, case-insensitive, against the **headline + feed description + categories**. The description is used **in memory only, for matching**. It's never stored or shown, because the plan forbids copying article text.
  - Any `exclude_terms` hit cancels that body's match.
  - Drop items that match no body.
- **`forward_looking`** = the headline or description contains a future-decision cue: `will vote`, `to vote`, `set to`, `proposed`, `proposes`, `considers`, `considering`, `could`, `plans to`, `weighs`, `hearing`, `budget`, `bond`, `tax rate`, `election`. It's **only a sort key**: forward-looking first, then newest. It never decides whether a mention is shown.
- **Output:** `NewsMention[]`, deduplicated by `external_id = sha1(normalized url)`; the same URL from two feeds is merged. The CLI is `npm run news -- --out tmp/news [--record]`.
- **Linking to agenda items** (pure function, used in Phase 2): `linkMentions(mentions, items)`. For each mention and each `upcoming` item of the same body whose meeting is within 30 days of `published_at`:
  - compute the token overlap between headline content words and item title content words, ignoring stopwords and the body's own aliases
  - if it's at least 0.35, plus at least one shared non-generic token (not `meeting`, `board`, `county` or `city`), the result is `{mention_id, item_external_id, score}`
  - keep only the best item per mention
  - **The link only goes from mention to item. A mention never creates, edits or upgrades an item.**
- **Display contract** (for P1's body pages; written into §12, not built by P2):
  - Label: **"In the news: may come up at a future meeting"**
  - Each row shows the outlet name, the headline exactly as published, the date and an external link
  - Fine print: "Headlines from news outlets. We don't write or check these stories, and nothing here is on an official agenda unless it says so."
  - When linked: "Now on the agenda: [item title] →"
- **Tests:**
  - feed parsing on recorded HPM and Community Impact fixtures
  - Community Impact path filtering (a Dallas or Austin item must be dropped)
  - alias and exclude matching. Near-misses: "Fort Bend County Commissioners Court approves…" must not match `commissioners_court`; "Dallas City Council…" must not match `houston_city_council`.
  - the forward-looking cues
  - dedup across feeds
  - `linkMentions`: one true link, one near-miss that must not link (a generic overlap like "board meeting")
  - the isolation lint rule and the type test
- **Checkpoint** (smoke: run the live feeds and log the mention counts per body; zero for some bodies is normal), then commit.

### Step 12: Health-check function (pure)
`health(result, history, sourceConfig, now): { ok: boolean; flags: string[] }`

It raises these flags:
- `fetch_failed`
- `no_meetings_{n}d`: the newest known meeting is more than `expected_max_gap_days` old **and** there's no future meeting. This replaces the plan's flat 14 days because of the Commissioners Court gap.
- `required_field_empty`
- `quote_reject_rate_{pct}`: when more than 20% of items are rejected
- `fallback_model_used`
- `scanned_document`
- `row_cap_hit_unpaginated`: a bug guard
- `redaction_leak_suspected`
- `awaiting_result_over_limit`: a meeting older than the source's `results_max_days` still has `awaiting_result` items (plan `c4ca60b`). The items stay `awaiting_result`; they're just no longer rechecked.
- `news_feed_failed`: a news feed fetch or parse failed. Info-level only; it doesn't make `ok` false, and it never affects agenda sources.
- `tax_rate_item_seen` (**for P1**, info-level): a new item's title, description or section matches `/tax rate|no[- ]new[- ]revenue|voter[- ]approval rate|truth[- ]in[- ]taxation|ad valorem tax|levy|tax hearing|rate hearing/i`. It also triggers when an item has an `Amount` with `kind: 'rate'`. The flag lists `{body_id, meeting date, agenda_number, title, source_url}` so P1 knows to enter or verify that body's `tax_rates` row. It's raised once per item (keyed by `external_id`), not on every run.
- `comment_rules_changed` (**for P4**, info-level): the normalized `comment_rules_text` of the newest meeting differs from the previous meeting's for the same source.
  - **Normalization:** run §5.5 `normalize()`, then strip dates, times, meeting-specific URLs (Zoom links, meeting IDs) and day names, so routine per-meeting changes don't trigger the flag.
  - The flag includes both texts and a word-level diff, so P4 can recheck that body's `registration_methods` recipe and its `last_verified` date.
  - It isn't raised when either meeting has no `comment_rules_text`; instead, `comment_rules_missing` (info) is raised once.
- **Tests:**
  - `tax_rate_item_seen` fires on the Lone Star Oct 1 tax-rate-hearing items. It does **not** fire on "arbitrage rebate payment" or "tax-exempt commercial paper" (event 1244).
  - `comment_rules_changed` doesn't fire across the two HISD fixtures when only the date and Zoom link differ, and does fire when a hand-edited fixture changes the speaker sign-up deadline wording.

Unit-test every flag.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.

### Step 13: Phase 1 wrap-up (then HARD STOP)
- Run every source's smoke test once more. Write a summary table to the progress log: source, meetings, items, warnings, flags.
- Write `tests/golden/README.md`: how to re-record fixtures, and which fixtures were trimmed.
- Write a **"Handoff to P5/P3"** section in the progress log that copies §12, updated with anything learned during the build.
- **Checkpoint**, then commit.
- **STOP.** Print: `Phase 1 complete. Waiting for P5 platform before Phase 2.`

---

## 9. Phase 2: platform integration (do not start until a human confirms P5 is ready)

At the start, check that these exist: `package.json` with `next`, `supabase/migrations/`, `lib/db.ts`, and P1's `bodies` seed. Plug into what exists. Don't recreate P5's work.

**P2-A. Migrations** (in P5's migration folder, P2-owned tables). These extend the Technical Plan's §16:
- **`sources`:** add `expected_max_gap_days int`, `last_flags text[]`, `last_error text`.
- **`documents`:** add `url`, `kind`, `meeting_external_id`. Index on `(source_id, url)`.
- **`meetings`:** add `end_date`, `status`, `content_hash`, `minutes_url`, `previous_date`, `last_results_check timestamptz`, `is_demo bool default false`. Unique on `(source_id, external_id)`.
- **`items`:** add `section`, `description`, `amounts jsonb`, `attachments jsonb`, `contains_private_person bool`, `quote_verified bool`, `needs_story bool default true`, `first_seen_at timestamptz default now()`, `removed_at timestamptz`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`, `is_demo bool default false`. Unique on `(source_id, external_id)`. `body_id` is the attributed body; add `meeting_body_id`. `status` gets a check constraint: `upcoming | awaiting_result | decided`.
- **`sources`:** also add `results_max_days int default 45`, `comment_rules_hash text` and `comment_rules_text text` (the last accepted version).
- **`meetings`:** also add `comment_rules_text text`.
- **New `p2_notices`:**
  - columns: `id`, `kind` (`tax_rate_item_seen` | `comment_rules_changed` | `comment_rules_missing`), `source_id`, `body_id`, `item_id` (nullable), `payload jsonb`, `created_at`, `acknowledged_at`, `acknowledged_by`
  - unique on `(kind, source_id, item_id)` for tax-rate notices
  - the admin page shows unacknowledged notices to P1 and P4
  - **Acknowledging a `comment_rules_changed` notice updates `sources.comment_rules_hash`** so the flag stops repeating
- **New `news_mentions` (D26):**
  - columns: `id`, `external_id unique`, `outlet`, `headline`, `url`, `published_at`, `forward_looking`, `matched_terms text[]`, `fetched_at`
  - **no article text column**
- **New `news_mention_bodies`:** `mention_id`, `body_id` (many-to-many).
- **New `news_mention_items`:** `mention_id`, `item_id`, `score`, `linked_at`.
- **There are no foreign keys from `items` to news.** News tables are never read by classify, stories, alerts or the review queue.
- RLS enabled on every table, with no anon policies.

**P2-B. Upsert pipeline** (`lib/ingest/run.ts`):
1. Load the source and the previous document hashes.
2. Run the adapter.
3. Upsert meetings. If `meeting.content_hash` changed, record the change so P3's `meeting_moved` can see it (e.g. `meetings.previous_date`).
4. Upsert items. On insert, or when `content_hash` changes:
   - call `classify()` (P3's if present, otherwise the stub)
   - set `tier`, `item_type` and `rule_fired`
   - set `needs_story = true`
5. **Review status:**
   - an LLM item with `tier = 'sms'`, or any item with `quote_verified = false`, gets `review_status = 'pending'`
   - when an `approved` item's hash changes and it still classifies as `sms`, it goes back to `pending` (D16)
   - Legistar, BoardBook and manual items skip review
6. **Items gone from a revised agenda** get `removed_at = now()`. Never delete them.
7. **Status moves (plan `c4ca60b`):**
   - **Upcoming → awaiting_result:** applied by the pipeline when the meeting start has passed and no outcome is posted. Doesn't set `needs_story` or trigger alerts. P3 shows it as "Outcome not posted yet."
   - **Awaiting_result or upcoming → decided:** happens when a `ResultUpdate` is applied (`action`, `vote_result`, plus a minutes `source_url` stored as the result source). Sets `needs_story = true` so P3 can refresh the brief in place. Never triggers new alerts.
   - A `ResultUpdate` with `quote_verified = false` goes to the review queue before it's applied.
8. **Late-added items:** new items on a meeting in the `near_term` window go through the full pipeline like any other. `first_seen_at` lets P3 and P4 detect that registration may already be closed (the plan's §11 "late-added" SMS wording is P3's).
9. Store the documents.
10. Run `health()`, and write `last_checked`, `last_success` and `last_flags`.

The whole run is idempotent: running it twice changes nothing.

**P2-C. `/api/cron/ingest`** applies the recheck windows (D21) on every call:
- Requires the `CRON_SECRET` header.
- **1. Near-term sweep (every call):** for **every** source, run `near_term` mode on meetings starting in the next 72 hours, **regardless of `last_checked`**. It's cheap: LLM documents whose hash hasn't changed are fetched but not re-extracted. Skip BoardBook between 00:00 and 05:00 Central.
- **2. Rotation:** run `rotation` mode on the one source with the oldest `last_checked`.
- **3. Results recheck (daily per meeting):** pick past meetings no older than their source's `results_max_days` that still have `awaiting_result` items and whose `last_results_check` is more than 24 hours old. Run `results` mode for at most 3 meetings per call, then update `last_results_check`.
- **4. News (lowest priority, every 3 hours):** run the news collector, upsert `news_mentions` and `news_mention_bodies`, run `linkMentions` against upcoming items, and delete mentions older than 60 days. This stage runs last and is skipped first when time is short. Its failures never affect stages 1–3.
- Use `maxDuration` as P5's Vercel plan allows. If the time budget is nearly used up, skip the later stages; they run on the next call (every 30 minutes). A big LLM document is processed one meeting per call, continuing on the next call using the document hashes.

**P2-C2. News read route:** `GET /api/bodies/[id]/news` returns at most 5 mentions from the last 14 days (forward-looking first, then newest), with any linked item's id and title. This is for P1's body page. If P1 prefers to own that route, hand the query to P1 instead and log it.

**P2-D. Scheduler (D5):** `.github/workflows/ingest.yml` runs on `schedule: '*/30 * * * *'` plus `workflow_dispatch`. It `curl`s the endpoint with `CRON_SECRET` from repo secrets. Add a daily Vercel cron in `vercel.json` as the backup. Stop and ask a human to add the repo secret; **don't push the workflow yourself** (commit it locally only).

**P2-E. Review queue `/admin/review`:**
- Protected by Supabase Auth plus the `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist.
- Lists `review_status = 'pending'` items, soonest meeting first. Each shows:
  - the item fields
  - the rule fired
  - the source quote **highlighted in the stored `pdf_text` document** (or a "⚠ scanned, quote unverified" banner with the PDF link)
- **Approve:** sets `approved`, `reviewed_at` and `reviewed_by`, then enqueues alerts through P3's interface.
- **Edit:** updates the fields, re-runs the amounts, redact, hash and classify steps, and stays on the page.
- **Reject:** sets `tier = 'timeline'` and `review_status = 'rejected'`.
- **Source health panel** at the top: any source with `last_flags`, shown in red.
- **Notices panel:** unacknowledged `p2_notices`, grouped into "For P1: tax-rate items to enter" and "For P4: public-comment rules changed" (with the diff). Each has an Acknowledge button.

**P2-F. DB-level golden tests:** run each Phase 1 fixture through `run.ts` against a test schema twice. Assert identical row counts, no duplicates and correct review statuses. Also include the plan's "recheck windows" tests:
- **Supplemental item:** a meeting 48 hours away has 10 items. A modified fixture adds an 11th. The next run picks it up even though the source's `last_checked` is recent, and sets `first_seen_at`.
- **Results:** a past meeting's items move `awaiting_result → decided` when a saved minutes fixture is added in `results` mode. A Lone Star meeting 46 days old is not rechecked and raises `awaiting_result_over_limit`; a MUD 489 meeting 62 days old **is** still rechecked.
- **News isolation:** after a full run with news fixtures, the `items`, `alert_queue` and review-queue counts are identical to a run without news.

**P2-G. Admin "run now" button** per source, which calls the ingest for that source.

**P2-H. Health:** flags from P2-B show on the admin page. No external alerting for the hackathon.

---

## 10. Things the agent must never do

- Write stories, SMS text or classification rules. Those belong to P3.
- Store or log a private individual's name outside `documents.raw` (§5.4).
- Parse attachments, or use the PDF "Packet."
- Fetch faster than once every 500 ms per host, or fetch BoardBook between 00:00 and 05:00 Central.
- Commit PDFs over 1 MB, `.env.local`, or `tmp/`.
- Push to any remote.
- Create demo or fake data (D18). Only the team adds that, later.
- Let news touch agenda data (D24 + D26): no news URL as an item's or meeting's `source_url`; no news text to Gemini; no news into classify, stories, alerts or the review queue; no items created or changed from news. News only produces `news_mentions` rows.
- Fetch news article pages, store article text or descriptions, or get around a paywall. Feed headline, link, outlet and date only.
- Scrape election results, Truth-in-Taxation notices, the HCAD protest deadline, or MUD 489's `/documents/` page. Those are hand-entered into `elections`, `tax_rates` and `deadlines` (P1's tables).
- Create items from minutes. Minutes only update existing items.
- Work on HISD Spanish agendas (deferred, §13).

---

## 11. Done criteria

**Phase 1 is done when:**
- [ ] All 4 automated adapters (Legistar, BoardBook, PrimeGov, LLMExtract) plus Manual return schema-valid `AdapterResult`s.
- [ ] Golden tests: Legistar 5 events, BoardBook 2 agendas plus the listing, PrimeGov JSON plus 1 agenda text, and LLM extraction with 3 real documents plus 5 corrupted outputs rejected.
- [ ] Redaction: 0 names leaked across all fixtures; the near-miss items are kept.
- [ ] All three statuses are produced correctly. `results` mode works for Legistar (refetch) and for minutes (Step 10).
- [ ] HC MUD 489: agendas and minutes discovered from filenames; the Oct 19, 2026 agenda extracted; the July 20 minutes matched to items.
- [ ] The news collector produces `NewsMention`s from recorded feeds. The isolation lint rule and type test pass, and the news-domain guard rejects news URLs in agenda sources.
- [ ] A live smoke test of each source is recorded in the progress log; running it twice gives identical IDs.
- [ ] typecheck, lint and tests are green, and there's one local commit per step on `scrapper`.
- [ ] The handoff notes (§12) are written.

**Phase 2 is done when:** ingest runs on schedule with all three recheck windows; it upserts idempotently and puts SMS-tier LLM and scanned items in the review queue; the review page works end to end; the health flags are visible; and both recheck-window tests (P2-F) pass.

---

## 12. Handoff notes: changes other parts must know about

1. **Types (everyone):** `Meeting` gains `end_date`, `status` and `minutes_url`. `Item.status` is `upcoming | awaiting_result | decided` (as in plan `c4ca60b`). `AdapterResult` gains `result_updates`. `Item` gains `body_id`, `section`, `description`, `amounts[]` (with `kind`), `attachments[]`, `contains_private_person` and `quote_verified`. `vote_result` becomes `'passed' | 'failed' | 'no_action'`; Legistar gives no tallies.
2. **Schema (P5):** the extra columns in P2-A, including `is_demo` on meetings and items, `items.meeting_body_id`, `items.first_seen_at`, `meetings.minutes_url`, `meetings.previous_date` and `meetings.last_results_check`.
3. **classify (P3):**
   - must accept the extended `Item`
   - must never return `sms` for personnel or closed-session items
   - should use `amounts[]` instead of re-parsing text
   - `meeting_moved` should compare `meetings.previous_date`
4. **Stories (P3):**
   - generated by P3's own job from `needs_story = true`, not inside ingest
   - personnel and closed-session items **do** get a story saying the session is happening, using "an employee" and never a name or school
   - `awaiting_result` items show "Outcome not posted yet." When a result lands, P2 sets `needs_story = true` so the brief updates in place.
5. **Weekly page (P3):** expect weeks with no Commissioners Court meeting (no meetings listed Oct 15 to Jan 14). Show `status = 'cancelled'` meetings as cancelled. Legistar results also lag by weeks, so Commissioners Court and HISD items spend time in `awaiting_result` too, not only MUDs and colleges.
5b. **Late-added items (P3/P4):** use `items.first_seen_at` against P4's registration close to choose the "registration may already be closed" SMS wording.
6. **Scheduler (P5):** GitHub Actions needs the `CRON_SECRET` repo secret and the deployed URL.
7. **P1:** confirm the `body_id` slugs (§5.2), including `hcmud_489` for the demo MUD (D25). Check that HC MUD 489 matches the CFISD demo address.
8. **City Council sessions span two days** (Tuesday public session, Wednesday agenda). Speak up registration (P4) should anchor to the right day.
9. **CFISD's meeting tomorrow (Oct 19)** is a chance to record a live BoardBook fixture with results later.
10. **HISD Spanish agendas are deferred** (§13). Spanish item pages have no `source_url_es` for now.
11. **P1:** election turnout, Truth-in-Taxation rates and the protest deadline stay hand-entered. The scraper doesn't touch those tables.
12. **Plan docs must be updated (owner decision D26).** These lines contradict the "might come up" box:
    - `Project_Plan.md` line 337 ("News is never pulled in as data")
    - line 432 (stretch goal "In the news" box): it's now core, not stretch
    - `Technical_Implementation_Plan.md` line 225 ("News sites are never a data source")

    The new rule: *news shows headline links on body pages labeled "may come up at a future meeting"; it never feeds items, alerts or stories.*
13. **P1 body pages:** render the "In the news" box from `/api/bodies/[id]/news` using the display contract in Step 11 (label, fine print, outlet attribution, "Now on the agenda" link).
14. **P5 privacy and terms pages:** mention that the app shows headlines and links from third-party news outlets.
15. **HC MUD 489 outcomes lag 1–2 months.** P3's "Decided this week" will show "Outcome not posted yet" for MUD items for a long time. `results_max_days` is 75 for this source, not the plan's 45.
16. **P1 (tax rates):** when a `tax_rate_item_seen` notice appears on `/admin/review`, enter or verify that body's `tax_rates` row from the official Truth-in-Taxation notice. The scraper never fills in rates.
17. **P4 (registration recipes):** when a `comment_rules_changed` notice appears, recheck that body's `registration_methods` recipe against the new text, update `last_verified`, then acknowledge the notice. `meetings.comment_rules_text` is also available if Speak up wants to show the agenda's own wording.

---

## 13. Deferred: HISD Spanish agenda linking (do not build now)

The owner deferred this in v1.2. It's kept here so it can be picked up later as its own step. When it's resumed, it would work like this:
- **Timeboxed search (45 minutes, max):** find where HISD posts Spanish agendas. `houstonisd.org/agenda` returned 404 on Oct 18. Try the HISD board pages, the Legistar `EventInSiteURL` meeting page and its attachments, and the agenda PDF's first page.
- **Linking only:** discover the Spanish agenda links (Step 5 code), match each one to the `hisd_board` meeting on the same date (using meeting-type words in the link text to break ties), and set `meetings.source_url_es`. No Gemini, and no item extraction.
- **Fallback:** a `data/manual/es_links.yaml` file (`- { date, meeting_type, url }`) using the same matching code.
- **Test:** every saved Spanish agenda links to the right Legistar meeting, including a same-date ambiguity case. This is the plan's "Spanish agenda linking" test, also deferred.
